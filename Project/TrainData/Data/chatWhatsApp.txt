Ritvick Pandey: Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of this chat, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.
Ritvick Pandey: bro we cant take in everyone who is interested from the group, but i dont want to say anything eihter
Himir Desai: yeah thats why i am being silent
Ritvick Pandey: hmm
Himir Desai: we can do some research from some local college actually in vadodara there is a Maharaja Sayajirao University (very well reputed here) maybe we can get help from them because they are not too big and neither it is too small
Himir Desai: it is funded by the king here
Ritvick Pandey: bro lets set a time for tmrw and then call, we can add another person too
Ritvick Pandey: yeah we need colleges like that
Ritvick Pandey: theres 2-3 in blr, where i live
Himir Desai: yeah we will request all of them atleast one will reply
Ritvick Pandey: well formulate a plan
Ritvick Pandey: our best shot is at BITS
Ritvick Pandey: even if they dont take us, im pretty sure they'll atleast guide us on what to do
Himir Desai: yeah we can go there ask some professors for guidance and then we can conduct our research from a nearby theek thaak college
Himir Desai: i will tell you the time in some time
Ritvick Pandey: haan, plus were also going to interact with the mars rover and Astro club
Ritvick Pandey: im sure there'll be some students in those clubs doing research currently
Ritvick Pandey: we can ask for help too
Ritvick Pandey: badhiya
Ritvick Pandey: see you tomorrow bro
Ritvick Pandey: enjoy party
Himir Desai: bye
Himir Desai: thanks
Ritvick Pandey: Ok also my dad is in the education business and can probably connect us to a professor so if that’s easier we could do that too
Ritvick Pandey: we found a partner
Himir Desai: yeah lets talk to her tomorrow till then you can msg her
Ritvick Pandey: ill just do it tmrw, just in case some other dude is there in the group who sees the message at night and can prove to be a lot more helpful
Himir Desai: yeah yeah
Himir Desai: At what time you are feee today
Ritvick Pandey: anytime after 7
Ritvick Pandey: that works for you?
Himir Desai: Yeah it will
Himir Desai: Found anyone?
Ritvick Pandey: cool see you then
Ritvick Pandey: from the bits group?
Ritvick Pandey: or a prof
Himir Desai: Yeah from there or any one would work not necessarily from bits
Ritvick Pandey: from the Bits group i don’t think we need a 3rd, if we take one let’s take her
Ritvick Pandey: hmm
Ritvick Pandey: you have anyone in mind bro?
Himir Desai: Nope
Ritvick Pandey: see let’s plan what to do in evening
Himir Desai: Okay
Ritvick Pandey: if our plan includes the necessity of a processor
Ritvick Pandey: then we’ll call her
Himir Desai: Okay done
Ritvick Pandey: if not we’ll just go ahead by ourselves
Ritvick Pandey: peace
Himir Desai: Okay then bye
Ritvick Pandey: HELLO
Ritvick Pandey: i’m excited
Ritvick Pandey: you look like a kaam ka banda
Ritvick Pandey: i’ve found 2/3 ppl from the BITS group like this i’m sure it’ll help for college scene
Himir Desai: (I assume this is what you sent them)
Ritvick Pandey: yup
Ritvick Pandey: 2 so far
Ritvick Pandey: you and the junior academy guy
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know about the others
Himir Desai: Nomadic? (Adarsh)
Ritvick Pandey: yessir
Ritvick Pandey: i like him, our hobbies match a lot too
Ritvick Pandey: also
Himir Desai: Yeah but he is a samaj ka bhala wada aadmi if you ask him he will tell everybody so choose your words appropriately also he has a startup so I don’t know if he will be willing to give time to this. Considering all this I have become a good friend of him from a few days so I can also talk to him
Ritvick Pandey: a prof responded to the emails i was sending to unis here
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: i haven’t talked to him about the research thing bro
Ritvick Pandey: i meant this in general
Ritvick Pandey: i spoke to him last week regarding programs and ECs and now he is a good friend
Ritvick Pandey: he told to educate ourselves first and think of research during undergrad
Ritvick Pandey: so not very helpful
Himir Desai: Ohh that will be difficult to respond to
Ritvick Pandey: he said it very politely, not in such a rude manner
Ritvick Pandey: he said first we need to have atleast undergrad level knowledge and then think of all this
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t say we only wanna do this for college applications
Himir Desai: Like what did you ask him?
Ritvick Pandey: his mail was sent to me by my high school teacher
Ritvick Pandey: she told he’ll help us out
Ritvick Pandey: so i asked for guidance, how to get started etc
Ritvick Pandey: he replied saying focus on getting into college and finish it
Ritvick Pandey: then do research
Himir Desai: I will talk to my mom and dad they might know someone from MSU. My parents are it’s alumni
Himir Desai: That’s what we are doing
Ritvick Pandey: how do you suggest we get started with the whole research thing?
Ritvick Pandey: do you have any plan other than
Ritvick Pandey: contacting professors
Himir Desai: We just need guidance then we can start independently
Ritvick Pandey: yeah
Ritvick Pandey: the problem is no prof will guide us cause we can’t help them in any way
Himir Desai: And we can get guidance from those who have done such a thing before
Ritvick Pandey: do you wanna add her?
Ritvick Pandey: we’d get some guidance atleast
Himir Desai: She’s in?
Himir Desai: Grade?
Ritvick Pandey: i have no clue
Himir Desai: Wait let me check in that poll
Ritvick Pandey: we need someone as serious, also someone who needs it. 11th and 12th graders seem perfect
Ritvick Pandey: i’d prefer if she was in 12th
Ritvick Pandey: so she works towards the deadline we have too
Ritvick Pandey: check check
Himir Desai: Yeah exactly
Ritvick Pandey: fucks sake
Ritvick Pandey: she’s in 9th bro
Ritvick Pandey: i just saw
Ritvick Pandey: what do you think?
Ritvick Pandey: we could still add her
Ritvick Pandey: after the guidance by the prof
Ritvick Pandey: we could slowly get into our own project
Ritvick Pandey: sounds bitchy but i mean
Himir Desai: From this the 12th wala cannot be chosen uska to application would be over and admission bhi ho Gaya hoga if he wants to go abroad
Ritvick Pandey: plus
Ritvick Pandey: he started math prep one day before his board exam
Ritvick Pandey: so i highly doubt he’d be interested anyway
Himir Desai: Tru
Ritvick Pandey: one guy said he had research experience no? in the group
Himir Desai: Ohh ha let’s check
Ritvick Pandey: Siddharth
Ritvick Pandey: again class 9
Himir Desai: Yeah just saw that
Ritvick Pandey: i’m staring to doubt the research exp
Ritvick Pandey: what do you wanna do?
Ritvick Pandey: one thing we can do is- ask how to start in the group and see the answers
Ritvick Pandey: worst case we pick up the professor waali
Ritvick Pandey: and go on from there
Himir Desai: I have applied for polygence and usme I will get scholarship because <90000 dollar is req and mine is approx 30000 on paper
Ritvick Pandey: i wanted to apply bro but it’s too exp
Ritvick Pandey: plus even after scholarship it’ll still be a lakh no?
Himir Desai: but it will take time to get an answer from there
Ritvick Pandey: it’s not 100%
Himir Desai: I am waiting for that only
Ritvick Pandey: i had checked online
Ritvick Pandey: scholarship provided was not that much
Ritvick Pandey: which is why i didn’t bother
Himir Desai: But they will get the research published guaranteed
Ritvick Pandey: there is one research program
Ritvick Pandey: 100 usd
Himir Desai: Which?
Ritvick Pandey: but it starts in august
Ritvick Pandey: my teacher said she’ll share shortly
Ritvick Pandey: it’s an indian program only
Ritvick Pandey: so like 7k rs
Ritvick Pandey: but aug is too late
Ritvick Pandey: we need to start asap
Himir Desai: In august it will be very late school mai exams bhi hogi
Ritvick Pandey: haan bro
Ritvick Pandey: kya kare?
Himir Desai: Mai dundhta hu kuchh
Ritvick Pandey: .
Ritvick Pandey: surely people’s answers will include what they can provide
Himir Desai: Yeah that we can do
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll help us choose a partner also
Ritvick Pandey: cool i’ll send message rn
Ritvick Pandey: you also add a supporting one
Ritvick Pandey: then i’ll look online
Himir Desai: Done
Himir Desai: Me too
Himir Desai: I was going to pay $5040 for Cornell precollege which I got admitted to but then I didn’t because the course wasn’t aligned with my goal
Ritvick Pandey: We first need a thesis statement
Ritvick Pandey: this is just a
Ritvick Pandey: how to get started on research google answer
Ritvick Pandey: i see
Ritvick Pandey: i was joining this program
Ritvick Pandey: here in bangalore itself
Ritvick Pandey: for 4lakh
Ritvick Pandey: they promised published research papers
Ritvick Pandey: but for some reason i don’t trust indians in such matters
Himir Desai: What will the subject of our research?
Ritvick Pandey: what do you wanna do when you’re older?
Himir Desai: AI
Ritvick Pandey: we are set on physics right?
Himir Desai: You?
Ritvick Pandey: research on AI would be too complex for now
Ritvick Pandey: mechanical engineering, AI, entrepreneur
Himir Desai: Yeah it will be but physics will be even more because it is an explored field AI is unexplored
Himir Desai: And so are many others
Himir Desai: I am not saying to do research on AI
Ritvick Pandey: yesyes I was just aise hi asking
Ritvick Pandey: anyway
Ritvick Pandey: in physics
Ritvick Pandey: theoretical physics
Ritvick Pandey: is a hot topic for research
Ritvick Pandey: now under that we can choose something
Ritvick Pandey: based on professors we find
Ritvick Pandey: I found a prof doing research on loop quantum gravity
Ritvick Pandey: and hes from a pretty chotta college
Ritvick Pandey: so hed let us help
Ritvick Pandey: but that topic will require toooo much laerning
Ritvick Pandey: lets see what others are saying in the GC
Himir Desai: Exactly
Ritvick Pandey: I say, we let sara contact a professor first
Himir Desai: In college what major you are expecting
Ritvick Pandey: Mechanical engineering
Ritvick Pandey: i was inclined towards CS in 9th-10th
Ritvick Pandey: now its mechanical
Ritvick Pandey: you?
Himir Desai: CS. Mechanical is too hard for me
Ritvick Pandey: opposite for me bhai
Ritvick Pandey: programming is not for me
Ritvick Pandey: i was going to learn in 10th but ive been delaying it since
Himir Desai: then we can do a collaboration type of thing you can do the pysical part i will make simulationd or models or something
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: what my plan was, ill learn cs simultaneously while/after my mechanical engineering
Ritvick Pandey: but i cant take cs and then do mechanical later on
Ritvick Pandey: this is perfect
Ritvick Pandey: sun
Ritvick Pandey: sara asked her dad
Ritvick Pandey: check gc
Ritvick Pandey: lets not put all hope into it though
Ritvick Pandey: ill still look for other ways, a program would be best bro
Ritvick Pandey: do you want to make a gc, sara, you and I
Ritvick Pandey: but problem is she might be friends with others from the bits gc
Himir Desai: see all of us
Ritvick Pandey: haan?
Ritvick Pandey: yaar i shouldn't have asked in the GC
Ritvick Pandey: We need to consider how much there is to research about
Himir Desai: yeah and if its indian good uni then even better
Ritvick Pandey: like what the fuck does that even mean
Himir Desai: like they have a lot of time they are in 9th they can do extensive research
Ritvick Pandey: well let them figure out plans
Ritvick Pandey: if one is good
Ritvick Pandey: you and I can use it and do our own project for college apps
Himir Desai: yeah and i am in Allen Global studies division i will ask my sir to connect me with alumni who has done similar stuff
Ritvick Pandey: ek broad topic Pehle decide karlete hain
Ritvick Pandey: so when were researching on how to research
Ritvick Pandey: itll be easier
Ritvick Pandey: like theoretical physics
Ritvick Pandey: works for you?
Ritvick Pandey: theoretical physics cause most unis offer research programs in theoretical physics only as far as ive found
Ritvick Pandey: so just in case we find one later on, we could use it to add on to our paper
Ritvick Pandey: badhiyaa
Himir Desai: If we ask a student currently in college (from india) who has done research in school then we can get guidance from him and he/she will guide us knowing the truth of why we want to research
Ritvick Pandey: i did just that
Ritvick Pandey: i saw this video of this guy getting accepted
Ritvick Pandey: into MIT
Ritvick Pandey: 3 days ago
Ritvick Pandey: and sent him a message
Ritvick Pandey: he hasn't responded yet
Himir Desai: no like someone who knows us someway
Ritvick Pandey: no one i know has done research in high school bro
Ritvick Pandey: these guys have made a separate research gc, join that in case they get good ideas
Himir Desai: find on linkedin i did that for a program and people are very helpful threr
Himir Desai: i will be sending connection requests to people tonight for guidance
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: im looking for people now
Ritvick Pandey: hopefully i find some indian students at ivies
Ritvick Pandey: or some masters students
Himir Desai: 👍
Ritvick Pandey: gimme updates tmrw
Ritvick Pandey: ill do the same
Himir Desai: ok
Ritvick Pandey: aa rahe ho kya
Ritvick Pandey: bhai only the 9th graders joined
Ritvick Pandey: im starting to feel like
Ritvick Pandey: call with them right now is a waste of time
Ritvick Pandey: you wanna leave?
Ritvick Pandey: theyre providing no valuable input anyway
Himir Desai: i am considering it as a call with you with some people disturbing us
Ritvick Pandey: exactly LMFAO
Himir Desai: Sure, here are some potential research topics related to mechanical heat transfer:
: 
eat transfer in advanced materials: You can research the thermal properties of advanced materials, such as nanomaterials, composites, or smart materials, and how they can be used to improve heat transfer in mechanical systems.
: 
eat transfer in renewable energy systems: You can research the heat transfer mechanisms in renewable energy systems, such as solar thermal systems or geothermal heat pumps, and how they can be optimized to improve energy efficiency.
: 
eat transfer in internal combustion engines: You can research the heat transfer mechanisms in internal combustion engines, such as diesel engines or gasoline engines, and how they can be improved to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency.
: 
eat transfer in microscale systems: You can research the heat transfer mechanisms in microscale systems, such as microchannels or microreactors, and how they can be optimized for various applications, such as chemical reactions or microfluidic cooling.
: 
eat transfer in industrial processes: You can research the heat transfer mechanisms in industrial processes, such as metal casting or welding, and how they can be optimized to improve product quality and reduce energy consumption.
: 
eat transfer in biomedical systems: You can research the heat transfer mechanisms in biomedical systems, such as cryopreservation or hyperthermia treatment, and how they can be optimized to improve patient outcomes.
Ritvick Pandey: bhai this Caltech student is perfect
Himir Desai: yeah
Ritvick Pandey: I dont see another way of going ahead
Ritvick Pandey: and this group is useless to do anything with
Himir Desai: 😂😂
Ritvick Pandey: half of them dont speak, when they do they suggest quantum loop gravity
Ritvick Pandey: we can continue tmrw instead of wasting our time today
Ritvick Pandey: and end the gc
Himir Desai: what else should i ask him
Ritvick Pandey: ill send a message saying I dont think we can do research
Ritvick Pandey: and then end the gc
Ritvick Pandey: dont leave
Ritvick Pandey: meeting rn
Himir Desai: i was just about to leave
Himir Desai: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhagrawal30/
Ritvick Pandey: do you think the Quantum School for Young Students 2023 program is worth it
Ritvick Pandey: considering its an offline program
Ritvick Pandey: the flight tickets itself will be 2-3 lakh
Ritvick Pandey: and visa
Himir Desai: They provide reimbursement
Himir Desai: Canada ka visa will be a good thing to have on my passport
Ritvick Pandey: hii
Ritvick Pandey: yess I saw
Ritvick Pandey: theyre providing bursaries
Ritvick Pandey: i wrote essay and finished everything else, only recommendation is left
Ritvick Pandey: what time do you usually sleep bro?
Himir Desai: Fees nahi hai usme koi
Himir Desai: Nothing is fixed it can be 10 or 5!
Ritvick Pandey: gooodmorning
Ritvick Pandey: caltech wala reply kiya kya
Himir Desai: Na
Ritvick Pandey: BRO\
Ritvick Pandey: LETSFUCKING
Ritvick Pandey: GOO

Ritvick Pandey: prof just
Ritvick Pandey: sent
Ritvick Pandey: this
Ritvick Pandey: LETS
Ritvick Pandey: FUKCIGN
Ritvick Pandey: GO
Ritvick Pandey: physics department professor at a university near my home
Ritvick Pandey: does research in astrophysics and the theory of releativity
Himir Desai: Ooooooooh
Ritvick Pandey: oh ym days
Ritvick Pandey: what do I say
Ritvick Pandey: im saying
Ritvick Pandey: thank you so much for the response sir, we just finished class XI and class XII will be starting from the coming week
Himir Desai: Continue talking to him (also mention me in the mails)
Himir Desai: Do we just need guidance from him or are you planning to research with him
Ritvick Pandey: see
Ritvick Pandey: I asked him
Ritvick Pandey: this
Ritvick Pandey: I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ritvick, and I am a high school student who is deeply interested in physics. My friend and I were discussing research opportunities and recently learned about your research in astrophysics and the theory of relativity, and we found it very fascinating.
: 
 am writing to you because we would love to learn more about these topics and get involved in research. However, we are not very knowledgeable about them at the moment, and we don't know where to start. I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how we can get started in learning about these topics and how we can eventually get involved in research.: am writing to you because we would love to learn more about these topics and get involved in research.

itvick Pandey: itvick Pandey
Ritvick Pandey: he responded saying
Ritvick Pandey: whether WE can do something or not depends on time
Ritvick Pandey: that means
Ritvick Pandey: hes problably
Ritvick Pandey: going
Ritvick Pandey: to let us do research
Ritvick Pandey: if not ill j ask him for guidance at the end of the day
Himir Desai: Sounds promising
Ritvick Pandey: yes
Ritvick Pandey: he repossessed
Ritvick Pandey: responded
Ritvick Pandey: in 4 mins
Himir Desai: You continue the conversation with him till then I am waiting for that caltech guy
Himir Desai: WHAT
Ritvick Pandey: i sent it at 12 he responded at 1204
Ritvick Pandey: TEAH
Ritvick Pandey: i checked mail rn and i saw his reply n i was like etc
Ritvick Pandey: wtf*
Ritvick Pandey: i feel bad for responding after 20 mins
Ritvick Pandey: when he did so quick
Ritvick Pandey: peace
Ritvick Pandey: we’ll look for more professors in nearby unis
Ritvick Pandey: turns out they’re free
Himir Desai: He must be desperate for some help and so are we
Ritvick Pandey: fucks sake
Ritvick Pandey: While I would be happy to give you a project, I worry that your XII standard being a crucial stage in your life, might get affected if you devote too much time to other things - can you please arrange so that your parents can write to me saying that it is fine for you to undertake a project?  Your studies and academics are an important part of your activities and they affect a lot on what you do next. I would like to have the feedback from them that you are doing fine and that they are okay with you working on a project (while your classmates might be slogging it out for IITs).
Himir Desai: There is only one good uni in Vadodara so I will be contacting some professors there now
Himir Desai: How much time does he expect us to give
Ritvick Pandey: idk bro
Ritvick Pandey: what should I respond saying
Himir Desai: Hmm I am blank rn
Himir Desai: Like how to ask this thing and also look good
Ritvick Pandey: madarchod chatgpt
Himir Desai: Order it to do so
Himir Desai: Or say that this is not False info
Ritvick Pandey: broi dont know what to say man
Ritvick Pandey: set
Ritvick Pandey: well figure something out
Ritvick Pandey: for now ive sent a mail to 3/4 more profs
Ritvick Pandey: hopefully something good comes out of it
Himir Desai: Okay
Ritvick Pandey: bro
Ritvick Pandey: he said
Ritvick Pandey: hell consider it
Ritvick Pandey: but for now
Ritvick Pandey: we should
Ritvick Pandey: focus on
Ritvick Pandey: 12th
Ritvick Pandey: its fine theres a lot more professors
Ritvick Pandey: and even the caltehc dude
Himir Desai: That going to come a lot actually wait I have a friend of mine in 12th rn giving his JEE and he did some research assistance in the one good college near my I will ask him too
Ritvick Pandey: YA uh
Himir Desai: me*
Ritvick Pandey: try and ask him
Ritvick Pandey: he should know exactly what to do
Ritvick Pandey: im glad indian professors are atleast willing to help though
Himir Desai: Yes exactly
Ritvick Pandey: I was not expecting that
Himir Desai: What I thought was we would have to bribe them 💀
Ritvick Pandey: im sad
Ritvick Pandey: I got
Ritvick Pandey: excited as fuck
Ritvick Pandey: for a while
Ritvick Pandey: not he just stopepd responding
Ritvick Pandey: HOWEVER this has given me
Ritvick Pandey: a lot of hope
Ritvick Pandey: from indina profs
Ritvick Pandey: if we send atleast 50 mails
Ritvick Pandey: we will surely get 1-2 positive replies
Himir Desai: I think idk why but I have experience like this so I never get to exited and so I do not get disappointed
Himir Desai: Yes we will
Himir Desai: Why Indians only
Himir Desai: Sone foreign professors if we can do remote
Ritvick Pandey: no because
Ritvick Pandey: I had
Ritvick Pandey: 0 confidence
Ritvick Pandey: that wed get a response from indian profs
Ritvick Pandey: but seeing one had me shocked
Ritvick Pandey: well send to them too ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: lets create
Ritvick Pandey: a template
Ritvick Pandey: with 2 paragraphs generic for all
Ritvick Pandey: and 1 paragraph will be
Ritvick Pandey: exclusive
Ritvick Pandey: only to that professor
Ritvick Pandey: mentioning his work and all
Himir Desai: Yes let’s do that
Ritvick Pandey: bro
Ritvick Pandey: one professor
Ritvick Pandey: just mailed
Ritvick Pandey: asking
Ritvick Pandey: if i wrote the mail myself
Himir Desai: And did you wrote it yourself?
Ritvick Pandey: yeah ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: im just saying, what an odd response
Ritvick Pandey: he didnt say anything after that
Himir Desai: He might have thought that chatgpt wrote it
Ritvick Pandey: Bhai
Ritvick Pandey: listen
Ritvick Pandey: send your marksheet
Ritvick Pandey: another prof replied!
Ritvick Pandey: he is asking
Ritvick Pandey: for both our marksheets
Himir Desai: 10th?
Ritvick Pandey: 11th ka hai to send
Ritvick Pandey: I dont
Ritvick Pandey: so I said im giving 10th
Ritvick Pandey: if u didnt get give 10th
Himir Desai: Even I don’t
Ritvick Pandey: send 10th then
Ritvick Pandey: the Caltech guy responded??
Ritvick Pandey: it should be morning where he is now
Ritvick Pandey: peace
Himir Desai: Not yet
Himir Desai: Caltech wala “you would want to read on your own and try to contact professors close to you to look for projects. I think it would be very tough to do research on your own in any field, with a lot more collaboration needed”
Ritvick Pandey: ah
Ritvick Pandey: fuck, I was hoping the Caltech wala could be of a lot more help
Ritvick Pandey: well keep contacting profs then
Ritvick Pandey: or we could just wait for the cornell wali ka program
Himir Desai: Actually I got to know that here MSU ke Computer Science Department Head is the parent of my brother’s room mate I think or atleast they are in same college and I have met him like 2-3 times on railway station because both my brother and all bits students of Vadodara come and go together
Himir Desai: So my mom dad have become atleast friends with that professor
Ritvick Pandey: oh?!?
Ritvick Pandey: but, what could we do research in in CSE?
Himir Desai: What we can do is ask him for some projects that’s what the Caltech guy said to look for projects or like I could be real in front of him because he is a friend of my parent first and professor second
Himir Desai: He can definitely help us
Ritvick Pandey: BADHIYA bro
Himir Desai: if you are applying this fall, I do not think you should be starting a new project. I would rather spend time on past projects, and your actual applications
Ritvick Pandey: I was thinking that we can contact BITS goa ka physics faculty before going there
Himir Desai: Caltech wala
Ritvick Pandey: and then when were there we could meet them irl
Ritvick Pandey: hmm
Ritvick Pandey: what do you think?
Himir Desai: I think that sounds good
Ritvick Pandey: we have 6-8 months for application deadline bro I think we have some time atleast
Ritvick Pandey: no I meant what do u think about what Caltech wala said
Ritvick Pandey: ok great
Ritvick Pandey: lets do it tomorrow morning
Himir Desai: Okay done
Ritvick Pandey: https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/physics/ResearchGroups
Himir Desai: See for the past projects I have not many
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: none that I would want to list as my 1st extracurricular
Ritvick Pandey: research is the best possible EC to have
Ritvick Pandey: which I dont have past exp in
Himir Desai: Yes
Ritvick Pandey: anyways I have school tomorrow so I gotta go sleep, lets contact the bits faculty tomorrow and see if theyre willing to help us
Himir Desai: Talking about that I would like to know your extracurriculars
Ritvick Pandey: my ECs are pretty messed up bro im ngl
Ritvick Pandey: im doing an internship at a stock brokage company
Ritvick Pandey: I did a machine learning internship at this company
Ritvick Pandey: im currently building a lake cleaning machine with my friend
Ritvick Pandey: and volunteering and stuff
Ritvick Pandey: not too impressive
Ritvick Pandey: which is why i need research
Ritvick Pandey: hby?
Himir Desai: Ohh that’s impressive
Ritvick Pandey: i mean you have Olympiad no? so youre chilling
Ritvick Pandey: but what else
Ritvick Pandey: im curious
Himir Desai: No that’s not true
Ritvick Pandey: cool
Ritvick Pandey: ill look more into it tomorrow
Himir Desai: That was in grade 9 and 10 I will have to show that I continue my legacy
Ritvick Pandey: so what are your ECS?
Ritvick Pandey: Being completely honest
Ritvick Pandey: i wasnt considering applying outside
Ritvick Pandey: until last year
Himir Desai: I am writing that only
Ritvick Pandey: which is why im lacking a LOT
Ritvick Pandey: you seem to have it all put together tho
Ritvick Pandey: okk
Ritvick Pandey: ill let u finish
Himir Desai: So I am the president of the CS Club at my school and right now we have just started to make a big project so we are making a software which schools can use very cheap which allows all of their busses to be tracked and both the schools and parents can see live locations
Himir Desai: Also I am the vice president of Math Club but it is fucking dead the president takes no interest
Himir Desai: Nor do other members
Ritvick Pandey: that is sick asl
Ritvick Pandey: bro how do you make a club in an indian school?!?
Ritvick Pandey: I thought gore log ka tha
Ritvick Pandey: our school is HUGE but it has no "clubs"
Himir Desai: Just go to the principals office with a plan in mind and make big promises
Ritvick Pandey: your school mustve had pre existing clubs na
Himir Desai: No I made them
Ritvick Pandey: i thought of doing so, but i got shut down by coordinator
Ritvick Pandey: oh, thats so cool bro
Himir Desai: This will show my leadership skill very well
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: oh haan i was school council member
Ritvick Pandey: vice captain and allt
Himir Desai: Fuck the coordinator and ask some subject teacher
Ritvick Pandey: thats what i thought ill use for leadershipskills
Ritvick Pandey: i have so umch to do this year bro
Ritvick Pandey: its one BT
Ritvick Pandey: i was doing JEE prep
Ritvick Pandey: im still writing JEE
Ritvick Pandey: but
Ritvick Pandey: yeah
Himir Desai: Me too I have a full syllabus 1(11th) test the day after tomorrow JEE Main style
Ritvick Pandey: haan ill do something
Ritvick Pandey: youre preparing for jee too??
Ritvick Pandey: i didnt expect that
Ritvick Pandey: then u understand the pain
Ritvick Pandey: advanced qs are so fucked bro
Ritvick Pandey: ok fuck i really need to sleep, ill talk to you tomorrow
Ritvick Pandey: well contact bits faculty
Ritvick Pandey: do some research on quantum computing
Himir Desai: Then I have made an app and it is on GitHub which can be used to share files to laptop and from laptop without downloading a simple application
Himir Desai: This is an app but it is not
Himir Desai: Like you download it on pc and that’s it now all of your house devices TV Phone other pcs laptops smart watches everything can use it without downloading a simple byte
Himir Desai: Yeah
Ritvick Pandey: oh wow wtf
Himir Desai: My other extracurricular if o get selected will be QSYS then there is the Olympiad and I run an NGO
Ritvick Pandey: that is REALLY cool bro
Ritvick Pandey: same ive applied to two programs
Ritvick Pandey: so QSYS or ISSYP
Himir Desai: And now you can transfer a file from your iPhone into a windows pc
Himir Desai: ISSYP I saw that when is the deadline
Ritvick Pandey: deadline got over long back bro, which is why i didnt tell you to apply
Ritvick Pandey: let me check if they extended it
Ritvick Pandey: i applied around a month ago
Himir Desai: Okay that’s why I didn’t apply because I know I saw it and the o rejected it for some reason
Ritvick Pandey: haan might have been
Ritvick Pandey: chalo i gtg sleep
Ritvick Pandey: goodnight bro tc
Himir Desai: Match 16
Himir Desai: Good night
Ritvick Pandey: yeah they might've extended it
Ritvick Pandey: you could try and send a mail to the admissions office to see if you can still apply
Ritvick Pandey: bhai im not getting sleep now because of the whole club thing
Ritvick Pandey: what did you even say to your princi?
Himir Desai: Wait let me show you my proposal file
Ritvick Pandey: all students in my school are so demotivated
Ritvick Pandey: i cant even make any promises
Ritvick Pandey: itll just be me
Himir Desai: Ye club rules hai
Ritvick Pandey: okk
Himir Desai: This is the actual file
Ritvick Pandey: your school seems damn chill bro
Ritvick Pandey: i highly doubt my princi will allow this
Ritvick Pandey: we have around 10k+ students
Ritvick Pandey: so princi doesnt meet anyone only
Ritvick Pandey: and coordinator told me to fuck off
Ritvick Pandey: idk ill think of something
Ritvick Pandey: thanks a lot bro
Himir Desai: Our school has like 2-3K maybe that is also too much maybe 1.5-2K
Himir Desai: You have to actually make your way into that room to prove your interest
Himir Desai: And then I don’t know I lured my principal into the idea
Himir Desai: Actually I messed up here the club name earlier was going to be the Codehead’s club but then our principal madam said to change it then I changed it to The Geek Guild everywhere but u forgot to change it below my sign on the last page
Himir Desai: I*
Himir Desai: One more thing if you want to tackle your coordinator if she at all wants to coordinate you are better of speaking authoritatively rather then using too many please in your request
Ritvick Pandey: I was thinking, I just won a physics tournament for my school 2 weeks ago and were asked to submit all winnings from school name to our admins office
Ritvick Pandey: so ill go there and ask if I can talk to the principal for 2 minutes
Ritvick Pandey: they cant refuse
Ritvick Pandey: thanks a lot fr bro I appreciate u actually helping
Ritvick Pandey: lets see ill think of something
Himir Desai: You will have to go prepared but
Himir Desai: This is an extracurricular
Ritvick Pandey: nah im not going to list all these in my Ecs
Ritvick Pandey: theyre local city tournaments
Ritvick Pandey: inter school
Ritvick Pandey: i would've put if we were us citizens
Ritvick Pandey: but were international applicants, so we have to be much better than the normal
Himir Desai: Like I if I had to ask I would say: Respected Ma’am this is a request to your regarding the conversation we had earlier regarding the formation of clubs where you denied me to do any such activity in the school. I would you to reconsider this request keeping any bias you had earlier. The formation of clubs will help other students getting out of their regular curriculum and will develop lots of soft skills in them….. and ese continue but I like sounding a little threatening tbh
Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO
Ritvick Pandey: u sound like youll kill her kids if she says no
Himir Desai: I like that that but there is no such evidence and this is extremely formal but it can be better if given more time
Himir Desai: Respected Ma’am,
, Himir Desai, am writing this email in reference to the verbal conversation I had with Vandana Ma’am regarding the formation of school clubs. I and my friend, Aryan Sharma, of class XI-D want to organise 2 clubs: one for math and the other for computer science (IP). The purpose of the formation of these clubs is to encourage curious minds and to expand their knowledge of respective fields.

Club meetings will be held as per requirement and quizzes and competitions will also be organized for the members. Any student from any grade can join the club if they are interested in that subject.

e would be thankful if the school permits the formation of such clubs and recognises them as a part of school rather than individual student groups. We would also be grateful if the teachers be a part of the group and help us if there arises any problem (but for the most part, being a student organisation, it will be managed by the members). After getting the permission to create these clubs we will start working on the activities and will share details about each club through subsequent emails. Also, Manisha Ma’am (Allen) has granted us permission to create these clubs if the school allows to do so.: e would be thankful if the school permits the formation of such clubs and recognises them as a part of school rather than individual student groups.

Himir Desai: Yeah I knew that
Himir Desai: You can always get scholarships after joining like per semester scholarships or you could do a part time job

Ritvick Pandey: my dad will be ready to fund, but ill just feel awkward asking him
Ritvick Pandey: considering I always troll my sister for wasting money

Ritvick Pandey: i got a mail back from a prof, i sent him both our marksheets
Ritvick Pandey: he hasn't responded since
Himir Desai: then dont feel that way if you get into a good college then you can repay it in like 2-3 years (plus never talk about replaying with your dad parents do not expect that kind of relations where you have to repay)

Himir Desai: Today we started the day with an amazing lecture on App development which was very informative. Next we had a class on Unique Value Proposition which was a hit. We got to learn about the concept of Moat: Something which protects the company from its competitors. Going ahead we had a marvellous session by Mr. Rao, the vice chancellor of BITS University, which made us delve into the world of nanotech. In the Creative thinking session we learned: “creation is an iterative process rather than a linear process”. The final movie on coal capped the day with an informative documentary of problems faced by the people.
Ritvick Pandey: Today, we commenced our day with a fascinating and awe-inspiring lecture on app development, which was exceptionally informative. Next, we attended a class on the unique value proposition, which was a resounding success. During the session, we were enlightened about the concept of "moat," which safeguards a company from its rivals. Later on, we indulged in a magnificent presentation by Mr. Rao, the esteemed vice-chancellor of BITS University, who broadened our horizons into the world of nanotechnology. Moving forward, in the creative thinking session, we absorbed the knowledge that "creation is an iterative process rather than a linear process." Lastly, the day culminated with a marvelous documentary film on coal, which shed light on the predicaments faced by people.

Himir Desai: 8-10 in us 5 in UK 1-2 in Canada in India 0 as of now
Ritvick Pandey: mech will be hard
Ritvick Pandey: i see
Himir Desai: SAME CS is super difficult
Ritvick Pandey: i’m thinking of writing BITSAT after the goa trip bro
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be easy to get desired branch also
Himir Desai: I am thinking the same but that would be the last last resort. CS ke teacher I saw
Himir Desai: It was not even copy paste it was even worse
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: it’s like
Ritvick Pandey: safety ka safety
Himir Desai: And i would go to a lower college for a better city and all
Ritvick Pandey: same yaar
Himir Desai: And UK mai PR is also kitna easy just 5 saal rehlo and achhi uni and job hui to its almost guaranteed
Ritvick Pandey: not edinburgh
Ritvick Pandey: but dil se i wanna go to Cambridge

Ritvick Pandey: wtf
Ritvick Pandey: ya uh
Ritvick Pandey: i’d live in a village
Ritvick Pandey: if the college was better
Himir Desai: Eggzactly but peace of mind rahega unlike us jisme H1B milega ya nahi phir green card apply kara to you can’t leave US and all
Ritvick Pandey: and placements were good
Ritvick Pandey: (kanpur)
Himir Desai: By city I mean environment I would never want to live in a big big city a village would be lovely but BITS mai to it was banjar aaju baju and you have to live in the college
Ritvick Pandey: my main criteria is
. Placements: . Placements
. Reputation: . Reputation
Ritvick Pandey: i can adjust everything else
Ritvick Pandey: haan thays the problem in BITS
Himir Desai: Mera main criteria is:
) Reputation : ) Reputation
) Stress free environment and People and all those social factors: ) Stress free environment and People and all those social factors
Ritvick Pandey: if i get into some place like IITD i’d want to stay outside in one villa and come and go as i please
Himir Desai: I would never want to go to New York or something it’s like a city but still a banjar type thing everyone busy with their own lives
Ritvick Pandey: bro same
Ritvick Pandey: i mean
Ritvick Pandey: not stress free
Ritvick Pandey: idc ab that
Ritvick Pandey: but reputation i need bro
Ritvick Pandey: or else it’ll be so ekbarsssing
Ritvick Pandey: when people ask kidhar se padhe
Ritvick Pandey: and i’ll have to say some gawar college
Himir Desai: Ha because I have been through extreme stress in my 9th and 10th Olympiads and all ka padna plus corona and all
Himir Desai: That to ofc
Himir Desai: Abhi I live a carefree life I don’t do any homework and sir even if he scolds me his next sentence is always to others ki ye bina padhe bhi marks le aega tum ise follow mat karna
Himir Desai: Once sir even said ki ye din mai 10 ghante Netflix dekhega to bhi achhi rank le aega
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll finalise my list by end of this week hopefully
Himir Desai: I will take a long time July tak finalise karunga
Himir Desai: And UCAS is rolling ki normal wala
Ritvick Pandey: rolling hai
Ritvick Pandey: i’m 99% sure
Himir Desai: To is it good ki bad?
Ritvick Pandey: see
Ritvick Pandey: i’d say it’s good
Ritvick Pandey: because
Ritvick Pandey: whenever you apply
Ritvick Pandey: you’ll get your response within the set time ( 2weeks mostly)
Himir Desai: Ohh that’s soo good
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: i read it somewhere
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t rmeneber where
Himir Desai: (If the decision is in our favour)
Ritvick Pandey: that u don’t have to wait
Ritvick Pandey: for deadline
Ritvick Pandey: to apply
Ritvick Pandey: you can apply from whenever the dates start
Himir Desai: September
Ritvick Pandey: and you’ll get decision within 2weeks
Ritvick Pandey: yeah
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭
Ritvick Pandey: even if it’s not
Ritvick Pandey: it’s good id say
Himir Desai: Ohh then it will be chill for JEE I would know ki I have some place to go
Ritvick Pandey: then ur not depending on it
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: if i get into cambridge before JEE
Himir Desai: Ha but UK mai they give conditional letters
Ritvick Pandey: I’ll be STRESS FREEE
Ritvick Pandey: 12th board mai kya difficulty bro
Ritvick Pandey: if i get conditional offer from cambridge
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll ditch JEE and only do board prep
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll have like 2-3 months
Himir Desai: Array no difficultly it’s just that our school does reckless checking so I am scared
Himir Desai: Idk why I am even giving JEE because NIT top mai bhi mila I won’t go and IIT top mai milna is very difficult because CS chahiye par if it is stress free then it will just be a feather on my cap (that’s what my maths sir say)
Ritvick Pandey: see
Ritvick Pandey: i’m giving because
Ritvick Pandey: if i get in na
Ritvick Pandey: like IITK ka some branch
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll be chill the 4 years
Ritvick Pandey: placements are ficking sexy
Ritvick Pandey: reputation is higher than any other college ( in india )
Ritvick Pandey: and i like the campus
Ritvick Pandey: so i’ll be able to work on whatever startup i have
Himir Desai: I just want maja nothing else
Ritvick Pandey: i’ve already done enough maja in my life bro
Ritvick Pandey: all i need is money
Ritvick Pandey: even though i don’t plan on doing a job
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll do one for atleast 2/3 years if my biz hasn’t popped off
Ritvick Pandey: another path i’m thinking is
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll do math and get into finance
Ritvick Pandey: investment bankers make BANK bro
Himir Desai: Us mai but it is difficult for international people to start a startup because you need a job to stay there (H1B) and I don’t know if you can file for yourself ig you can’t
Himir Desai: Then paisa hi paisa
Ritvick Pandey: not much of an issue
Ritvick Pandey: lets say were MIT students
Ritvick Pandey: with a startup idea
Ritvick Pandey: we can shift back to india

Himir Desai: Like I am better than 99% people but in the top 1% i am the bottom wala
Himir Desai: AGSD ke sir
Ritvick Pandey: The MAT is designed to be approachable for all students, including those without Further Mathematics A-level or equivalent. It aims to test the depth of mathematical understanding of a student rather than a breadth of knowledge. The mathematical knowledge and techniques required to do the questions are taken from a syllabus roughly corresponding to AS-level Maths, with a few extra topics from A-level Maths. If you're unsure what this covers, you can find the full MAT syllabus on the practice materials tab on this page.
Ritvick Pandey: AS level
Ritvick Pandey: what is AS level
Ritvick Pandey: isnt that
Ritvick Pandey: chutiyon ka level
Ritvick Pandey: in IB
Ritvick Pandey: bhai then toh this is aasan

Ritvick Pandey: Mathematics, Mathematics and Statistics, and Mathematics and Philosophy applicants should attempt questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
athematics and Computer Science applicants should attempt questions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6: athematics and Computer Science applicants should attempt questions 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
omputer Science and Computer Science and Philosophy applicants should attempt questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7: omputer Science and Computer Science and Philosophy applicants should attempt questions 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
xford applicants who are also applying to courses at Imperial College London and/or the University of Warwick should attempt the questions required by the Oxford course they are applying for.: xford applicants who are also applying to courses at Imperial College London and/or the University of Warwick should attempt the questions required by the Oxford course they are applying for.

Ritvick Pandey: has taken Hinduisms side
Ritvick Pandey: bfro my school is super fucked upt
Ritvick Pandey: they try to make sure no one gets good marks
Ritvick Pandey: thats why they put exams 1 week after opening school
Himir Desai: Achha you also reported nice nice
Himir Desai: This is in my school as well but exams are properly timed atleast
Himir Desai: Also we get many questions of the question paper before the test. Because it is a dummy to they have different exam dates for fitjee Allen and Akash to we have their papers before our exam and many questions are similar
Ritvick Pandey: bro wtf man
Ritvick Pandey: thats not fucking fair bro😭
Ritvick Pandey: we have such fuckall qs
Ritvick Pandey: that I can ace an advance test
Ritvick Pandey: but not my school test
Ritvick Pandey: "define radius of gyration" 3 marks
Ritvick Pandey: who the fuck
Ritvick Pandey: memorises all this bro
Himir Desai: Ha but they check so badly people who got 94+ in boards are getting 75-80%
Ritvick Pandey: and if its not exact textbook definition they cut marks
Himir Desai: It’s not even a 1 mark question wtf
Ritvick Pandey: it is
Ritvick Pandey: we have to write
Ritvick Pandey: the 3-4 lines from ncert
Ritvick Pandey: then some definition
Ritvick Pandey: that maam told in class
Ritvick Pandey: and then something
Ritvick Pandey: its so fuckall
Ritvick Pandey: and I enver go to school so I didnt even know all this BS
Ritvick Pandey: i wrote the one line definition
Himir Desai: Achha I thought ki it’s a one line definition ki distance where to put all mass to get same moment of inertia
Ritvick Pandey: along with the
Ritvick Pandey: formula
Ritvick Pandey: and i got 1/3
Ritvick Pandey: like this only
Ritvick Pandey: these madarchods
Ritvick Pandey: cut off all marsk
Himir Desai: That is the case here as well they asked to prove laws of motion for 3 marks (justifiable) I didn’t put the integration limits I directly wrote the ans like I just skipped one line nothing else and 1 mark kaat diya
Himir Desai: Then English mai to they cut 1/2 in all questions and say there must be something I cut these marks for think about it
Ritvick Pandey: same bruh wyd
Ritvick Pandey: wtf*
Ritvick Pandey: bro but ur school seems so line at
Ritvick Pandey: lineant
Ritvick Pandey: i wish i went to a dummy school too
Ritvick Pandey: our counsellor is also stupid bro
Ritvick Pandey: she’s like our studnets have gone to caltech
Ritvick Pandey: so it’ll be easier for u
Ritvick Pandey: to get into caltech
Himir Desai: I was in dummy from 9th never regretted
Ritvick Pandey: because our school is recognised
Himir Desai: Is your school listed on common app and college board? I have to select not listed wala option
Ritvick Pandey: ghanta
Ritvick Pandey: even if it was, it doesn’t help my application at all
Himir Desai: Check pg4u.co.in

Ritvick Pandey: then we can do the same
Himir Desai: Array you know bits se I send my friends our photos they also said ki Tera naya friend achha lagta hai
Himir Desai: Ha to wo professor ki beti nahi na
Ritvick Pandey: aay haiye😁😁
Ritvick Pandey: arrey yaar
Ritvick Pandey: isliye she had no other achievements
Ritvick Pandey: only the IITD wala
Ritvick Pandey: wtf yaar
Ritvick Pandey: oh
Ritvick Pandey: i thought you said she is professors beti
Ritvick Pandey: i didn’t read fully
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t think she is
Ritvick Pandey: but it is a possibility
Ritvick Pandey: let’s see what she says
Himir Desai: Ha I am at a restaurant will talk to you later
Ritvick Pandey: okk
Ritvick Pandey: himir
Ritvick Pandey: would you say you’ve found meaning/purpose in life
Ritvick Pandey: if not why do anything
Ritvick Pandey: sorry for randomly springing the question on you, i j felt like asking someone and you’re someone i think is smart enough to answer
Himir Desai: To experience fun and happiness of different kinds . Friends Relations Wife Children Grandchildren Retirement
Ritvick Pandey: i see
Himir Desai: I have just cleared level 1
Ritvick Pandey: of?
Ritvick Pandey: that is the closest i’ve come to as well
Ritvick Pandey: whenever i try to think of something
Ritvick Pandey: everything else seems pretty.. well pointless
Ritvick Pandey: still i’m not satisfied
Ritvick Pandey: anyway thanks
Himir Desai: 1) Friends
) Relationship: ) Relationship
) Wife: ) Wife
) Children: ) Children
) Grandchildren : ) Grandchildren
) Retirement: ) Retirement
Ritvick Pandey: oh so level 1 in this
Ritvick Pandey: i thought some program
Ritvick Pandey: i was reading this book na
Ritvick Pandey: and in the book the author says
Himir Desai: What I said was the motive of my life the purpose I still don’t know. And as of now I would say ki purpose is finding purpose
Ritvick Pandey: most of the people take up money, success, or like you said to experience fun in various relationdhips as a goal
Ritvick Pandey: but that is just to cope with the fact that there’s no actual purpose
Ritvick Pandey: later on he says we try to find ways to become happy and not just try to be happy
Himir Desai: There is no purpose. Think of a world without the earth nothing would change
Ritvick Pandey: this sentence contradicts this
Ritvick Pandey: because having good relationships
Ritvick Pandey: is a reason to be happy
Ritvick Pandey: so overall i’d say it’s a shit book
Ritvick Pandey: so i thought i’d ask someone
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: doesn’t that piss you off
Ritvick Pandey: i’ve been trying since a while bro probably like 6th grade
Ritvick Pandey: nothing movie like has struck me so far
Ritvick Pandey: and i doubt anything will
Himir Desai: What is happiness a feeling? That’s it
Himir Desai: So even that is pointless
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: isn’t that
Ritvick Pandey: irritsting
Himir Desai: In 6th I was an NPC tbh
Ritvick Pandey: that your entire consciousness is a spark of some random particles
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO why do i understand that
Ritvick Pandey: me too until 5th
Ritvick Pandey: 6th is when i’d say i like took control from auto drive
Ritvick Pandey: anyway
Ritvick Pandey: then why do anything
Himir Desai: Ha it is. The only one thing that brings me happiness as of now and that too very short and that is the dream of some good small house with a nice girl
Himir Desai: In a village
Ritvick Pandey: this pissed me off a lot toll 8th then i just said to myself might as well make a lot of money to have a little fun in a meanfinelss life
Ritvick Pandey: but i’m thinking even that will become pointless
Ritvick Pandey: after a while
Ritvick Pandey: dekh but
Ritvick Pandey: that will just fuck your condition even more na
Ritvick Pandey: because one day she’ll die
Ritvick Pandey: then you’ll be much worse off
Ritvick Pandey: than before
Ritvick Pandey: now you’re stuck in a keanginless existence
Ritvick Pandey: and you’re sad
Himir Desai: (Even masturbating is boring sometimes)
Ritvick Pandey: i think only being totally obsessed with a girl is something that would remove this constant itch of purposelessness
Ritvick Pandey: but even that would fade after sometime don’t u think
Ritvick Pandey: i mean that we’ve only seen in movies
Himir Desai: Nahi that’s not the thing she will not die because this will never happen in the first place
Ritvick Pandey: not even one example irl
Ritvick Pandey: bhai😭
Ritvick Pandey: then u can’t say this as an answer
Ritvick Pandey: for real
Ritvick Pandey: i haven’t done also in a while i lost the habit when we went to BITS
Himir Desai: I said for a short time then I realise it isn’t going to happen
Ritvick Pandey: ohh i thought you meant
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll bring you happiness in the future
Ritvick Pandey: for a short while
Ritvick Pandey: i see
Ritvick Pandey: then why do anything himir
Ritvick Pandey: if even you don’t
Ritvick Pandey: find anything
Ritvick Pandey: not to sound too nihilistic
Ritvick Pandey: but yes
Himir Desai: Because if I don’t then I will have to answer to many people (parents friends) that I find even worse
Ritvick Pandey: bro but even that doesn’t matter after a point na
Ritvick Pandey: don’t just think rn
Ritvick Pandey: class 12
Ritvick Pandey: like in general
Himir Desai: But I can’t just suicide
Ritvick Pandey: when you’re 40
Ritvick Pandey: you won’t happen to tell ur parents
Ritvick Pandey: 🤣🤣🤣
Ritvick Pandey: I KNOW
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t either
Ritvick Pandey: which is why i’m asking
Ritvick Pandey: so there are better alternatives
Ritvick Pandey: bhai your messages are so random😭😭😭
Ritvick Pandey: suicide and masturbation
Himir Desai: Today I will think while sleeping
Ritvick Pandey: kuch toh hona chahiye na
Ritvick Pandey: usually i ignore it
Ritvick Pandey: or postpone it
Ritvick Pandey: abhi vella betha tha to sochne laga
Ritvick Pandey: goood
Himir Desai: The best time of the day is just before waking up when I am partially awake
Ritvick Pandey: chal i’m looking forward to see your text tomorrow morning
Ritvick Pandey: right after this
Ritvick Pandey: fuck i love that too
Ritvick Pandey: and then i crack my back
Ritvick Pandey: 😫😫😫
Ritvick Pandey: such short moments of happiness make me ignore the meaninglessness
Himir Desai: Pop?
Ritvick Pandey: haan whatever
Ritvick Pandey: ykwim na
Ritvick Pandey: it feels too good
Himir Desai: I do that to my neck both the sides
Ritvick Pandey: that morning stretch
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: anyways
Ritvick Pandey: i enjoyed talking to you himir
Ritvick Pandey: dhanyavad for saying stuff i guess
Ritvick Pandey: chal goodnight
Himir Desai: Goodnight
Ritvick Pandey: also fick i didn’t come off as suicidal no
Ritvick Pandey: i asked this chick i was hooking up with once
Ritvick Pandey: and she thought i’m going to kms
Ritvick Pandey: which is why i don’t ask dumbfucks anymore
Himir Desai: KMS?
Ritvick Pandey: kill my self
Himir Desai: Just realised
Ritvick Pandey: chal i’ll text you tomorrow morning i’ll go think too
Himir Desai: I do not ask anyone for life advice other than my mom and myself
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t ask mom either
Ritvick Pandey: this wasn’t life advice
Ritvick Pandey: i just wanted to know
Ritvick Pandey: if others feel the same
Ritvick Pandey: then i realised
Himir Desai: I have asked just 3-4 times in my life
Ritvick Pandey: most are
Ritvick Pandey: NPCs
Ritvick Pandey: that don’t actually think that deep
Ritvick Pandey: so i thought i’ll ask off
Ritvick Pandey: hain
Ritvick Pandey: i want waisa connection with my mum
Himir Desai: Most are blinded by JEE and IITs
Ritvick Pandey: but i don’t trust anyone with such decisions
Ritvick Pandey: so i usually sit and think myself
Ritvick Pandey: haan but i wish i was like that too
Ritvick Pandey: that is so badhiya na
Ritvick Pandey: you’d be happy with a college
Ritvick Pandey: then happy with a job
Ritvick Pandey: then die off happily
Ritvick Pandey: without ever thinking so much
Ritvick Pandey: they’re living the same life except they’re constantly happy
Himir Desai: I wished that till last year ki why I matured earlier because I started to think of life from 9th onwards while other were busy with their cricket ball
Himir Desai: But then now I think ki it’s a non sense race they are running in
Ritvick Pandey: this has been me since class 6-7
Ritvick Pandey: then i saw that it is stupid after entering class X
Ritvick Pandey: yes exactly
Ritvick Pandey: but still
Himir Desai: Only top 1000 ranks have such privileges
Ritvick Pandey: .
Ritvick Pandey: bhai people die for VITs
Ritvick Pandey: different people hage different goals
Ritvick Pandey: different “IITs”
Himir Desai: VIT mai mere bhai ka ek dost hai he barely passes 12th boards
Ritvick Pandey: kuch log ke liye just Btech is enough
Ritvick Pandey: i’m saying isn’t that great
Himir Desai: Passed*
Ritvick Pandey: because they live happily
Ritvick Pandey: why are only some of us
Ritvick Pandey: fucked
Ritvick Pandey: same humare school ke saare failures went there
Himir Desai: I always wanted to be that class ka student who passed due to teachers grace and still he was so happy and carefree
Ritvick Pandey: i had a similar discussion about how others are NPCs and live happily with my sir
Ritvick Pandey: when i was a kid na
Ritvick Pandey: for a long period i was happy
Ritvick Pandey: that i’m not like other dumbfucks
Ritvick Pandey: and can actually think for myself
Ritvick Pandey: but now i’m thinking what’s the point anyway might as well couldve been happy
Himir Desai: But then I see one of my friend he is not one of them but he is still 75% wala so it’s low. He to the world appears so happy and full of life but as I am one of his friend I know he is hollow from inside. It isn’t what it looks like
Ritvick Pandey: whay the fucj are you speaking about me cause i told i got that much in chem
Ritvick Pandey: 🤣🤣🤣
Ritvick Pandey: i got 98 in phy mother fucjer fuck you
Himir Desai: Majority of people in my class and school think I don’t need to worry for anything. I will get a good rank and college and good job it’s so easy for you. But that’s what I show them it’s not what I truly gave
Himir Desai: Face*
Himir Desai: Nahi it’s saumya one of my childhood friend from play school
Ritvick Pandey: isn’t it tho
Ritvick Pandey: compared to ptjers
Ritvick Pandey: i’m 100% sure
Ritvick Pandey: i have no problem
Ritvick Pandey: getting a good college
Ritvick Pandey: people suicide for IITs
Ritvick Pandey: even if i don’t study much i can definitely get 3-4k rank and go to IIT kharagpur
Ritvick Pandey: i’m sure u can too
Himir Desai: But that’s not what brings me happiness. Good college for them is not good for me
Ritvick Pandey: haan again
Ritvick Pandey: they’re NPCs
Ritvick Pandey: anyway it seems like a
Ritvick Pandey: endless convo cuz again
Ritvick Pandey: we cant find an answer to it
Ritvick Pandey: that’s so FUCKING irritating na
Ritvick Pandey: chal anyway goodnight
Himir Desai: In my school or class I would be the most carefree person hands down. I fucking don’t do any homework and I confidently say teachers that I haven’t
Himir Desai: but that’s because I am lazy but I give excuse to myself ki I don’t have time
Himir Desai: I want to change that that’s why I have started to bring drastic changes to my lifestyle now. Insta to I had deleted yesterday and now I intend to build a good sleep cycle
Himir Desai: Then I will organise everything to get sone free time just for myself listening to songs being with friends for fun and not studies going to concerts (in May there are 30 consecutive concerts it’s called taste of Vadodara)
Ritvick Pandey: wait i’ll be right back
Ritvick Pandey: my mom is screaming
Ritvick Pandey: i promised her i’ll sleep early and wake up at 6
Himir Desai: My mom sleeps at 10 and she has no idea what I do after that
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: i used to give excuse of this only
Ritvick Pandey: that oh nothing has meaning anyway
Ritvick Pandey: and let all that slide
Ritvick Pandey: it never bit in my back cause i still scored good and all
Ritvick Pandey: so i just let it be like that
Ritvick Pandey: BRO i had this want of change
Ritvick Pandey: right after BITS
Ritvick Pandey: but now it’s gone again
Ritvick Pandey: aye sexy
Ritvick Pandey: ok bye for real this time i’m trying to fix sleep schedule too
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll text you tomorrow morning to see what you thought of
Ritvick Pandey: haan same she just got up because i was in the kitchen making sounds
Himir Desai: But for me I have told to n number of people about this change and now I can’t step back and get taunts from them that’s why I told that so that I cannot not do it
Ritvick Pandey: yaar wtf
Ritvick Pandey: i tried this same exact thing but now i just feel like a besharam
Ritvick Pandey: wtf same exact thing
Ritvick Pandey: thays why mom was screaming
Ritvick Pandey: i told her i’ll fix sleep sched and all
Ritvick Pandey: but i didn’t
Ritvick Pandey: now her taunts also aren’t bothering me
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll tell someone else so the taunts are effective’s
Ritvick Pandey: effective*
Ritvick Pandey: bro the madarchod probpem is
Ritvick Pandey: whenever i get a feeling of doing anything
Himir Desai: I have been through it i sat doing nothing for weeks at a time
Ritvick Pandey: this stupid question
Ritvick Pandey: somehow comes
Ritvick Pandey: back into my mind
Ritvick Pandey: and kills the feeling
Ritvick Pandey: anyways goodnight aakhri baar
Ritvick Pandey: sube uthna hai warna maa gali degi
Himir Desai: Okay mai likh raha tha but now good night I will msg tomorrow
Ritvick Pandey: nahi ab likhna padega
Ritvick Pandey: or else i will stay curious
Himir Desai: Ok wait
Himir Desai: Ha to as I said I have been through this and at that time just because of this I slept at 10pm woke up at 2pm (to minimise thinking) and sat in a room alone watching YouTube to entertain me missing all the classes and just went outside the room for meals. This was when I realised ki India mai there is no hope for a life like how I am living right now and the thought of living a worse life scared the hell out of me
Himir Desai: And tab I decided I am not staying in India still I was depressed af
Ritvick Pandey: bro you won’t believe it cause i’ve been saying same same since tjen but same exact thing happened, but then this bubble burst as well when i went to Dubai and everything still sucked
Himir Desai: How I fixed that feeling even I don’t know mostly spending more time with friends
Ritvick Pandey: this happened with me twice
Ritvick Pandey: once in 11th last year and once in 6th
Himir Desai: The happiest time in my life was in Goa at YEB tbh
Ritvick Pandey: i stopped going out of my room completely and just sat in fucking irritation
Ritvick Pandey: i was tooo depressed
Ritvick Pandey: i didn’t expect it at all but again same
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know if it was because it was right after my 11th
Ritvick Pandey: or if i like being busy all the time
Ritvick Pandey: but YEB was definitely the happiest i’ve been
Himir Desai: I have not had any bubble burst and so I still find peace in the thought of going abroad but soon I will face the reality over there
Ritvick Pandey: nahi actually you know what
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t say
Ritvick Pandey: it’s a total bubble burst
Ritvick Pandey: the average feeling
Ritvick Pandey: is MICH BETTER AABROAD
Ritvick Pandey: because everything is just so much better to look at
Ritvick Pandey: but that is also only for a week or maybe a month
Ritvick Pandey: then you’ll get used to it and then bubble burst
Himir Desai: Exactly
Himir Desai: But US mai visa will be a hanging sword over our heads
Himir Desai: H1B milega phir green card milega aur green card apply kara to we are basically trapped in US
Ritvick Pandey: already bichara futta hua hai bubble😭😭 aur nahi faadte hain
Ritvick Pandey: let’s have one comfort thought until it too goes next year
Ritvick Pandey: ok anyways, aakhri wala goodnight
Ritvick Pandey: kal subay msg karta hoon
Himir Desai: Good night
Ritvick Pandey: anything else to say???
Ritvick Pandey: bol hi de, 2 min lagega
Himir Desai: Nahi just ki I will marry a us citizen and green card mil gaya (sewing the bubble)
Ritvick Pandey: roommate dhoondlenge US mai
Ritvick Pandey: mai patana bhi sikha doonga
Ritvick Pandey: badhiya plan ekdum
Ritvick Pandey: if u shift to a country like dubai
Ritvick Pandey: citizen ship u get from buying property
Ritvick Pandey: dubai is somewhere i’m considering living
Ritvick Pandey: once i’m done with college and all
Ritvick Pandey: life is just too ficking good over there
Himir Desai: WTF then let’s go to Dubai and buy jameen phir we go to us we will be the first in green card ki line because country cap mai India is full Dubai is not
Ritvick Pandey: bhai peace????done
Ritvick Pandey: ok bye fuck kitni baar bolunga
Ritvick Pandey: see you tmr goodnight
Himir Desai: Good night
Ritvick Pandey: goodmorning
Ritvick Pandey: socche kuch?
Himir Desai: I could get the answer ofc but I thought some things
Ritvick Pandey: could or couldnt?
Himir Desai: couldnt
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: what did you think
Ritvick Pandey: getting the answer is obviously
Ritvick Pandey: not something
Ritvick Pandey: thats possible
Ritvick Pandey: after one night of thinking atleast
Himir Desai: one being ki god was invented by people who faced the same problem
Ritvick Pandey: this is a pretty famous theory
Ritvick Pandey: i ahd thoguth the same until i saw online
Ritvick Pandey: thats what most of the atheist people say
Ritvick Pandey: one? means u thought of more?
Himir Desai: yeah
Ritvick Pandey: batao
Ritvick Pandey: or if ur busy rn tell later cause i also have kaam shaam
Himir Desai: i am not busy but you do your kaam shaam i will take some time to articulate my thoughts into text
Ritvick Pandey: ok cool
Ritvick Pandey: but you should also be busy
Ritvick Pandey: whaat happened to sticking to a schedule and all
Ritvick Pandey: your boards ka schedule was gaand faafd
Ritvick Pandey: ok u write ur thoughts down ill brb
Himir Desai: ha i will do that but aaj subah ka pura time mere dada ka passport renewal application mai chala gaya and AC service wale log ae and mom isn't at home to i have the responsibility to look after them
Ritvick Pandey: ohh okk
Himir Desai: Ha to back to point of life ke thoughts. Mera dusra thought was ki i have to earn enough so that i can be one of the early mars settlers. but these all childish thoughts main wala i had thought and now i forgot to i will have to rethink
Himir Desai: main thought ye tha ki what i want to be is a wanderer. Like every few months i would like to explore new places and what is the point of it you ask. There is no point I remembered ki i was known for doing silly things and i loved it in the future i also want to do totally pointless things like making a boat in my backyard in free time, gifting my mom a single diamong solitare ring because i promised to her as a joke in 6-7th. but ye sab ke liye you need money and so i will go to foreign desh. for a software engineer now more than any other fields remote jobs are available and they pay even more because company doesn't need to spend on electricity, transport, food, etc. To there are just 2 things i will need in the future time and money and untill i do not get them i have a reason to live i wont think what will i do after getting them thats left for then. Ha and do not judge the english i just types as thoughts came in my head
Ritvick Pandey: you know what
Ritvick Pandey: I like this answer
Ritvick Pandey: after that u will save
Ritvick Pandey: to think
Ritvick Pandey: for then
Ritvick Pandey: makes sense
Ritvick Pandey: this will
Ritvick Pandey: lead u to
Ritvick Pandey: to be
Ritvick Pandey: productive too
Ritvick Pandey: 😂😂
Ritvick Pandey: even id want
Ritvick Pandey: a ritvickpur
Ritvick Pandey: or a town
Ritvick Pandey: with just my friends
Ritvick Pandey: as citizens
Ritvick Pandey: so thered be like a kartthik avenue, himir ave etc
Ritvick Pandey: how sick would that be
Ritvick Pandey: everyone in Mahals
Himir Desai: And we will be able to play real life minecraft over there
Ritvick Pandey: yess
Ritvick Pandey: okay that is a good goal
Ritvick Pandey: chal ill go do kaam shaam
Ritvick Pandey: ill lyk if I ever think of anything
Ritvick Pandey: you also make ur sched again

Ritvick Pandey: ill try fixing sleep sched also, from today
Himir Desai: Yesss
Himir Desai: Ha me too
Himir Desai: Once these AC wale people are wasting kitna time
Himir Desai: ~Once~
Himir Desai: AP ko I have given a lot of time but 4 subjects ke liye I have just one week and magnetism I have to learn from scratch and statistics too
Ritvick Pandey: I have done something similar, like classes and certain courses ko toh I have given fixed time
Ritvick Pandey: rest everything I will write down before I sleep
Ritvick Pandey: which 4?
Ritvick Pandey: Mechanics wont take any time
Ritvick Pandey: magnetism isnt that hard
Ritvick Pandey: i havent seen stats syllabus
Himir Desai: The thing is during boards everything was certain I wrote the entire week ka time table because nothing unexpected could come during that time
Himir Desai: I will give mechanics just 1-2 hours before the test date not more than that
Himir Desai: Ha that is a pain in the butt usme there are so many terminology
Himir Desai: And formula sheet mai many important formulae are not given
Ritvick Pandey: i have put a lot of chill for now
Ritvick Pandey: but thats because i just got started today na
Himir Desai: Chemistry Mech E&M Stats
Ritvick Pandey: oh haan
Ritvick Pandey: stats is a headache
Ritvick Pandey: but once youre done with that
Himir Desai: You have no classes right only school 2 days a week
Ritvick Pandey: questions will be done with ease
Ritvick Pandey: no i do
Ritvick Pandey: 2pm - 7pm

Ritvick Pandey: chem is just mugging up
Ritvick Pandey: i hate it
Ritvick Pandey: even retards ace chem its so irritaitng

Ritvick Pandey: nahi jaana what he asked bro
Ritvick Pandey: chem se meri phat ti hai
Ritvick Pandey: how do u suggest i do chem
Ritvick Pandey: since its only rattaing
Ritvick Pandey: i always ignored it
Ritvick Pandey: sinc ei have a bad base
Ritvick Pandey: ive been skipping chem since class 6 itself
Himir Desai: To I said kyuki as it is the “rate” constant diffrentiating will bring the power down as the coefficient to air said exactly what I was looking for
Himir Desai: sir*
Himir Desai: rate constant nahi sorry
Himir Desai: Equilibrium
Himir Desai: Rate to kinetics mai
Himir Desai: Thought rate constant is the equilibrium constant of rate determining step
Ritvick Pandey: himir😁😁😁😁😁 chemistry ki baat chodd de😁😁😁😁😁
Himir Desai: To doesn’t matter
Ritvick Pandey: listen
Ritvick Pandey: will u be scheduling
Ritvick Pandey: an entire week

Ritvick Pandey: that American math contest
Ritvick Pandey: i aced it in class xi
Ritvick Pandey: these fuckers write in class xii
Ritvick Pandey: i wrote it
Ritvick Pandey: after blundering
Ritvick Pandey: my tests
Ritvick Pandey: to make u p for them

Himir Desai: I am stressed about all artificial things like ab mai kya karunga ye series ke characters se pyar ho gaya hai unhe ab nahi dekh paunga
Himir Desai: You are in real stress
Himir Desai: So what do you think after all this how much do you think you will score?
Ritvick Pandey: see
Ritvick Pandey: in 9th my score was
Ritvick Pandey: 96 or sum
Ritvick Pandey: 96 ya 97
Ritvick Pandey: in 10th also
Ritvick Pandey: in 12th also minimum itll be 97-98
Ritvick Pandey: only 11th is the bad scene
Himir Desai: Or if you can have your parents meet the principal and ask them for a good predicted score they also know the truth they might be willing to help you
Ritvick Pandey: im at the mercy of the admission officers
Ritvick Pandey: yeah
Ritvick Pandey: aur kuch hai nahi
Ritvick Pandey: tab bhi 11th ka daag reh jayega
Ritvick Pandey: stressssssssssssssssss
Himir Desai: If you can also ask them to increase that
Ritvick Pandey: na that they wont do for sure
Ritvick Pandey: plus my parents
Ritvick Pandey: wont let me ask also
Ritvick Pandey: only two options are there
Ritvick Pandey: one is IIT
Ritvick Pandey: second is
Ritvick Pandey: see if PAT is before i submit application
Ritvick Pandey: then if i submit a 100 PAT score
Ritvick Pandey: oxford will have to consider me
Ritvick Pandey: even after my 11th
Ritvick Pandey: i dont want to do the 1st option
Himir Desai: It isn’t ig most of the people gave it in Nov-dec
Ritvick Pandey: haan thats what
Ritvick Pandey: and
Ritvick Pandey: ucas deadlien
Ritvick Pandey: is
Ritvick Pandey: 25th jan
Himir Desai: Oct 16 my boy not January
Ritvick Pandey: wtf
Ritvick Pandey: bhai???
Himir Desai: Let me check thoroughly
Ritvick Pandey: bhai aur matt darao😭
Himir Desai: Achha nahi 16 is for medical
Ritvick Pandey: it jan only
Himir Desai: But it’s rolling admission and it starts from sept 5
Ritvick Pandey: haan but
Ritvick Pandey: its not
Ritvick Pandey: first come first serve basis
Ritvick Pandey: so if pat results are out by dec lest say
Ritvick Pandey: i could submit by jan
Ritvick Pandey: but that seems v unlikely
Ritvick Pandey: fuck yaar IIT nahi jana yaar
Ritvick Pandey: NTU only needs 10th and 12th so i can go there
Himir Desai: Then what’s the point of rolling
Ritvick Pandey: NTU, Oxford ya IIT
Ritvick Pandey: worst case
Ritvick Pandey: HOPEFULYL
Ritvick Pandey: koi usa wali dua dede
Himir Desai: IIT you are so sure of? Chemistry ka kya
Ritvick Pandey: i dont relly know either
Ritvick Pandey: but ur not getting
Ritvick Pandey: preference
Ritvick Pandey: if u apply earlier
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: IIT toh ho jayega yaar
Ritvick Pandey: Phy and math
Ritvick Pandey: i can do now only
Ritvick Pandey: i have 1 year
Ritvick Pandey: to learn
Ritvick Pandey: 1-2 hcaps of chem
Ritvick Pandey: for minimum cutoff
Himir Desai: Nahi it’s all show things. If the seats are filled they won’t accept new students
Ritvick Pandey: and ill get high rank ( low rank )
Ritvick Pandey: from phy and math
Ritvick Pandey: but iit i dont want at all bro
Ritvick Pandey: and for a good branch
Ritvick Pandey: at good hostel
Ritvick Pandey: ill have to sit and do
Ritvick Pandey: jee chem
Ritvick Pandey: for the next year
Ritvick Pandey: which again i dont wanna do
Ritvick Pandey: fuck yaar
Ritvick Pandey: bahut badi samasya hai
Himir Desai: If I were you I would pray god everyday for some solution and I do not believe in any god I just believe in the god not any religion and I have never been disappointed by them
Ritvick Pandey: thanks yaar😂 atleast ur giving solutions
Ritvick Pandey: pray hi kar sakta hoon
Ritvick Pandey: i can hopefully get better predicted
Ritvick Pandey: 11th idk bro fuck yaar FML
Ritvick Pandey: IIT is infuriating bro
Ritvick Pandey: i dont want to be in india
Ritvick Pandey: for the next 4 years allso
Ritvick Pandey: i have an itch to go abroad
Himir Desai: And I would take advice from someone who actually know all this and has experience rather than just thinking in my mind. Also whoever you ask he/she should be someone who really cares for you and not doing his job
Ritvick Pandey: bro
Ritvick Pandey: wtf does this mean
Ritvick Pandey: While the 15 October deadline is usually inflexible, don’t worry if you miss the January deadline.
Ritvick Pandey: ucas ke website par
Ritvick Pandey: ???
Ritvick Pandey: that makes no sense
Ritvick Pandey: October is inflexible dw if u miss January wala
Himir Desai: Heinnnnn
Ritvick Pandey: what is this englis
Ritvick Pandey: bhai wtf October 2024 hai kya
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: ok
Ritvick Pandey: tab woh hi hai
Himir Desai: Oct 16 for any course at Oxford
Ritvick Pandey: dekh UK wale predicted lete hain
Himir Desai: Or Cambridge

Himir Desai: And the deadline is 16th October so start making arrangements with your school
Ritvick Pandey: yaar
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe koi
Ritvick Pandey: chutiyo ke college to jaana nahi
Ritvick Pandey: India mai rehna nahi
Himir Desai: Bhai London is super expensive 5K per month that’s 60K saal ka itni to average salary hai
Ritvick Pandey: option to hai nahi
Ritvick Pandey: haan thats also there
Ritvick Pandey: Singapore ka only advantage is that
Ritvick Pandey: but NTU also
Ritvick Pandey: i dont wanna go too much
Ritvick Pandey: USA main tha yaar
Ritvick Pandey: but NTU is ranked 4th for engineering
Ritvick Pandey: after MIT, camrbdige and oxford
Ritvick Pandey: so its a decent abroad backup
Ritvick Pandey: but yaar usa gaya yaar
Himir Desai: NTU ki NUS
Ritvick Pandey: ntu ka placement bhi sexy hai
Ritvick Pandey: avg 60lakh per year
Ritvick Pandey: NTU
Ritvick Pandey: nus is 8th or something
Ritvick Pandey: for engineering
Ritvick Pandey: in business and all nus is higher
Himir Desai: achha I will check it Singapore ka passport is the most powerful in this dharti
Himir Desai: on*
Ritvick Pandey: only
Ritvick Pandey: w of ntu
Ritvick Pandey: for me
Ritvick Pandey: is unka campus

Ritvick Pandey: udhar bhi karlena
Ritvick Pandey: time nahi lagta
Ritvick Pandey: plus only 10th and 12th
Ritvick Pandey: ntus placements are high
Ritvick Pandey: rank is 4
Ritvick Pandey: before Stanford Caltech also
Ritvick Pandey: my plan was
Ritvick Pandey: MIT if not Camrbidge if not NTU if not Stanford Caltech Carnegie mellon
Himir Desai: Unka decision comes after our 12th result tab Tak us walo be fees bhi le li hogi
Ritvick Pandey: haan but i thought of ntu
Ritvick Pandey: as a backup
Ritvick Pandey: if i didnt get mit
Ritvick Pandey: so id get ntu before
Ritvick Pandey: writing advanced
Ritvick Pandey: koi ek hi kyu
Ritvick Pandey: Singapore mai 4 saal nahi reh paaonga
Ritvick Pandey: but ill have the most

Himir Desai: I don’t know maybe followers ya connections can see but I don’t know
Ritvick Pandey: cause he hasn't listed it in experience also
Ritvick Pandey: no one can see
Ritvick Pandey: its not visible to anyone dw
Ritvick Pandey: we have an option to make it visible or not

Ritvick Pandey: was fucking EVERYONE the ENTIRE WORLD at one point of time
Ritvick Pandey: thats crazy
Himir Desai: Ha but hitler ka uniform was very bad he did not have any think fur wala coat and diamond wala crown. I know he wasn’t a king he was a dictator but uska uniform still sucks
Himir Desai: ~think~
Himir Desai: thick*
Himir Desai: Ye DALLE is now useless I asked it to generate an image of hitler wearing all this and it fucking says ki it’s against our policy. Pehle it did whatever we asked it to do

Himir Desai: in that atlas the traffic jar wala question is troubling my brain
Ritvick Pandey: hain
Ritvick Pandey: bhai this sounds so fun yaar

Himir Desai: what sounds fun the name of question?
Ritvick Pandey: no the atlas application
Ritvick Pandey: i like mindfuck probpems
Ritvick Pandey: problems
Ritvick Pandey: solving them gives so much satisfaction
Himir Desai: Ha but it’s fucking my mind because the question is ambiguous but now I know which meaning they are talking about
Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO oh fuck
Ritvick Pandey: oh you got it?
Ritvick Pandey: congrats
Ritvick Pandey: then i have classes
Ritvick Pandey: at 8pm ill do the Qs
Himir Desai: Array I got answer but there are 2 interpretations of the question and now I have 2 answers I don’t know which to put but I am slowly slowly getting which one is the intended interpretation
Himir Desai: Half of the questions are straight simple maths problems the remaining half are subjective with multiple answers. There are only 2 such questions I am saying half because I think they will have more weightage
Himir Desai: Because the ask why did you answer that so they want to know your thinking in other questions they just want answers
Ritvick Pandey: i saw the question
Ritvick Pandey: isn’t it pretty simple, 8
Ritvick Pandey: or i don’t know i haven’t thought much yet just gave it a read
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll do it and let you know at night
Himir Desai: Ha at first read I thought it’s a simple question but then I now think ki I misunderstood the question. Abhi bhi it’s simple only but now I am confused between 2 answers but the more I think one of them becomes more obvious than the other
Ritvick Pandey: are we speaking about the traffic jam q only
Ritvick Pandey: hain
Ritvick Pandey: ok
Himir Desai: Ha but 8 is not either of my 2 answers
Ritvick Pandey: you’re increasing my
Ritvick Pandey: excitement
Himir Desai: Yes
Ritvick Pandey: wtf
Ritvick Pandey: it cannot be higher
Ritvick Pandey: LEAVE let’s not discuss i’ll do it at night and text
Himir Desai: Ok
Ritvick Pandey: oh haanits not 8
Ritvick Pandey: its 7
Himir Desai: Ha that’s one of my answers and it’s the one which I have 90% confidence in
Himir Desai: And now you have reinforced it and also I have thought a lot about it it’s 100% 7
Ritvick Pandey: haan it has to be 7 na
Ritvick Pandey: I just looked and said 8 but didnt think that we could take 5 raspberry and 3 cherry
Ritvick Pandey: so wed be left with only 2 of those
Ritvick Pandey: 7 is the correct choice

Ritvick Pandey: UOFT acceptance rate is like 46% ( for cs it’s just 5-6%) but i say it’s easy because
Ritvick Pandey: i know this bhaiya
Ritvick Pandey: and he’s pretty matlab
Ritvick Pandey: i wouldn’t say dumb

Himir Desai: Better than India atleast. And you would be bored asf india mai bhi placements mai if you don’t get international to you will get one in Bangalore and you would get even more bored
Ritvick Pandey: na
Himir Desai: And I don’t think you will make a mistake to go for masters without any work experience
Ritvick Pandey: i’d prefer India over UK
Himir Desai: To he’s rejected
Ritvick Pandey: IIT has guaranteed good placements
Ritvick Pandey: and i’d get a good group to fuck around with
Ritvick Pandey: in UK a first of all
Ritvick Pandey: environment is only so depressing
Ritvick Pandey: plus i’m sure i won’t find a group of people i like
Ritvick Pandey: plus UK placements aren’t good
Ritvick Pandey: plus i’m scared i’ll get stabbed by some black man
Ritvick Pandey: literally 50% of london has been jumped at one point of
ime: ime
Ritvick Pandey: no i might not even do masters
Ritvick Pandey: unless i’m not rich
Ritvick Pandey: then i’ll get an MBA from stanford

Himir Desai: Bye
Himir Desai: Hello
Ritvick Pandey: hello
Ritvick Pandey: kuch important hai kya abhi math kar raha hoon
Himir Desai: In 12th CBSE has brought something new or I didn’t knew it existed. We have to make a project in physics and chemistry in teams and prepare a report with all the experimental data. Now our sir said ki if it is above 12th level then only you will get full marks otherwise it will look like you copied from book
Ritvick Pandey: hain? I knew it was a thing in AI I didnt know math aur phyiscs ke liye bhi hai
Ritvick Pandey: it must be new
Ritvick Pandey: what a waste of time smh
Ritvick Pandey: team ke saath karna is another headache
Ritvick Pandey: is inter school allowed or does the teammate have to be my classmate
Himir Desai: I had seen Stanford ki summer school application they did ask for project work in each subject to be submitted I don’t know about the undergrad application
Himir Desai: Arrays it’s optional you can also do solo
Himir Desai: It’s like you do in teams but print 3 separate reports to even if we do inter school it’s not a problem because I won’t be submitting my team name
Himir Desai: Ha and it has to be typed not handwritten
Ritvick Pandey: thats good then
Himir Desai: Our sir said ki you should only refer achha material from Google scholar
Ritvick Pandey: i dont think they ask for anything else in undergrad
Ritvick Pandey: stnaford ka application is thru commonapp na
Ritvick Pandey: Common Application

Ritvick Pandey: nah undergrad mai ye sabkuch nahi check karte ( hopefully )
Ritvick Pandey: haan its not there
Ritvick Pandey: its off of their website
Ritvick Pandey: what do you plan on doing
Himir Desai: Why tf they are not asking for essays
Himir Desai: Not planned yet
Ritvick Pandey: i think i will get the project over with now itself, so as to save time later on
Ritvick Pandey: yaar mere school mai
Ritvick Pandey: they will force me to do with some of their students
Ritvick Pandey: so others get good score as well
Ritvick Pandey: basically a bunch of fucking Prachis
Ritvick Pandey: if interschool is allowed you want to do together??
Himir Desai: 💀
Ritvick Pandey: we can get it done in a week
Ritvick Pandey: but i dont think it will be
Himir Desai: It’s like we just have to submit a printed document and I don’t think we will have the same checker to not an issue if we just change the name and submit
Ritvick Pandey: badhiya then done
Ritvick Pandey: ill ask for more details about it and we can get it over with now itself
Himir Desai: And then there will be viva to sir told to choose topics carefully
Ritvick Pandey: ohh
Ritvick Pandey: ye toh 11th mai bhi hua tha
Ritvick Pandey: i get it now
Himir Desai: 11th mai there was just practical and journal+viva
Ritvick Pandey: oh
Ritvick Pandey: we had to do a project
Himir Desai: Now it’s practical + journal + project + viva
Ritvick Pandey: and submit reports
Ritvick Pandey: each member
Ritvick Pandey: had to submit
Ritvick Pandey: own report
Himir Desai: what did you do
Ritvick Pandey: even tho it was same printout
Ritvick Pandey: and then we were asked viva on it
Ritvick Pandey: idk it was teacher made team, so my classmates did it
Ritvick Pandey: it was a waste of time
Ritvick Pandey: we had to choose from our schools expirement lab book
Himir Desai: How do you expect getting good LORs then?
Ritvick Pandey: the topic was rolling motion, ik because in viva they asked
Ritvick Pandey: 11 and 12 different teachers
Ritvick Pandey: i have Chatto-fied class 12 ki teachers
Ritvick Pandey: plus, our school gives very good LOR for college to even the shittiest students
Himir Desai: Achha but don’t they ask how many years the teacher has taught the child the more the better
Ritvick Pandey: because school ka hi naam accha hoga if students get in na
Himir Desai: Ha then they should also forge report cards ba
Himir Desai: Na*
Ritvick Pandey: that is illegal na😭
Himir Desai: Achha ha our sir both Phy and Chem told that you can take either a topic from practical ka book or your own
Ritvick Pandey: for programs
Ritvick Pandey: its one headache to get LOR
Himir Desai: Isn’t beating up someone and then forcing them not to file an FIR illegal
Ritvick Pandey: i hjad to ask my class t4eacher
Ritvick Pandey: then HOD
Ritvick Pandey: and wait for principals approval
Ritvick Pandey: then i got it
Ritvick Pandey: haan but then i cant take any action on that na
Ritvick Pandey: dps ka owner is a mafia bos
Ritvick Pandey: boss
Ritvick Pandey: ill get vanished in 2 days
Himir Desai: I just called some it department person and then they gave me school email and password
Ritvick Pandey: if i say anything
Himir Desai: IT department *
Ritvick Pandey: thats sick asf
Ritvick Pandey: ok chal ill continue doing math
Ritvick Pandey: ill ask my teacher for more deets about the project
Ritvick Pandey: then we can start doing
Himir Desai: Ha but all the LORs from my school goes from info@gvhs.in email not from teacher ka email because teacher ke email are not shared with students (but if I personally ask a teacher they would be more than ready to give me) but I think it’s good only because @gmail.com would look very bad
Himir Desai: Ha and I will order a pizza and watch the good place ka episode one
Ritvick Pandey: what all ep1s did you watch till now?
Ritvick Pandey: lmk how it goes
Himir Desai: Ha
Himir Desai: I was going to watch GoT ka because uske reviews mai people say ki even though last season was shit it is still the best and the have not found any other series better. But unfortunately india mai GOT not available

Ritvick Pandey: and i dont want ot watch drama
Ritvick Pandey: do u think its worth it
Ritvick Pandey: i trust your taste
Ritvick Pandey: Team leader task
Himir Desai: its like history things if you like. but more than that its a pura cycle of people each want to defeat the other and then they team up they betray each other and all first season mai thoda pyar pyar hai but hten its like constant stabbing in the back
Himir Desai: I love history and medieval architecture and the entire idea of monarchy so i very much liked it

Himir Desai: and one more thing this rishi is asking me ki as maam said ki there can be multiple team leaders can he be one? he asked me last week ig and i said him ki there are already 2 leaders more wont be needed but then he is saying all blah blah things so now either we make him our pawn and ask him to do all the majdoori ka kaam or we say him no and after you all had gone i and he were only there and we were ache wale friends so i cant bluntly say him no. so if we will have to say no to him you will have to

Himir Desai: Wahi to but its like cigarette we know its bad and all but somehow we cant stop iy
Himir Desai: it*

Ritvick Pandey: and i told him well group study at 1100
Ritvick Pandey: ill sit on call with him
Ritvick Pandey: and seeing him study ill forced to do so

Himir Desai: Achha but I procrastinate too much i would even say ki lets not joij group session today i will do it tomorrow

Ritvick Pandey: this hair suits u more also
Himir Desai: Nai my hair is like this only i can make then do whatever i want when short
Ritvick Pandey: keep the phone to ur side (like how u did in this pic but u don’t in others) and put ur head a little down, like look down atleast 15 degrees
Ritvick Pandey: and rotate ur neck a bit to the side
Ritvick Pandey: again 15ish degrees
Ritvick Pandey: that’s how to take a good mirror selfie
Ritvick Pandey: that’s so cool wtf
Ritvick Pandey: i have no option other than down cause my hair is too softish
Ritvick Pandey: rn at this length however i’m able to put them up somehow
Ritvick Pandey: perfect
Ritvick Pandey: look at the difference
Ritvick Pandey: between this and other ones
Ritvick Pandey: now keep the phone in this line only
Ritvick Pandey: but u can move it more upwards
Ritvick Pandey: or downwards depends on convenience
Ritvick Pandey: but always take pic with that angle
Ritvick Pandey: jaw bhi badhiya diktha hai
Ritvick Pandey: and we both have good side profiles
Ritvick Pandey: better compared to front
Ritvick Pandey: so it suits us
Ritvick Pandey: wtf😭
Himir Desai: Side ke liye

Himir Desai: In this field
Ritvick Pandey: ignore the hair i’m getting it cut tomorrow
Himir Desai: Your hair grows incredibly fast
Himir Desai: Badhiya tutorial
Ritvick Pandey: my phone is always there in all pics and vids
Ritvick Pandey: haan its very frustrating
Ritvick Pandey: thats why I dont like keeping it short, I end up getting a cut every 2 weeks
Ritvick Pandey: to maintain it like this
Himir Desai: How much is haircut cost in Bangalore where you do achhi jagah hi jata hoga
Ritvick Pandey: nahi it depends
Ritvick Pandey: the accha place i used to go
Ritvick Pandey: it varies a lot actually
Ritvick Pandey: average accha place is 500
Ritvick Pandey: where i used to go costed me 1-2k
Ritvick Pandey: my barber (the guy who i go to always now who gave me the short hair) costs 160
Ritvick Pandey: and his shop is right next to me so it’s perfect
Ritvick Pandey: tera barber kitna leta hai?
Ritvick Pandey: it’s 160 so i don’t even mind getting cut biweekly
Himir Desai: Achha pehle i went to some 50-100 wala i am talking about the tome when mummy used to take me like 2nd -5th around phir i went to 200 wala place phir after corona they increased their price to 240 abhi i go to 400 wala place waha par mast billiards table and sab kuchh hai free coffee tea and all
Himir Desai: time*
Ritvick Pandey: waah
Ritvick Pandey: mummy wala hi used to be 1-2k for me
Ritvick Pandey: when I went with dad 500 mai hota tha
Ritvick Pandey: abhi 160
Ritvick Pandey: my barber guy and I have gotten pretty close also
Ritvick Pandey: in 9th-10th I used to go to him before every big event
Ritvick Pandey: so literally every week
Ritvick Pandey: uske khudh ke baal nahi hai
Ritvick Pandey: but he cuts so good
Ritvick Pandey: we waste a lot of time on hair
Ritvick Pandey: before I used to do it alone ab hum dono saath mai karte hain
Himir Desai: It seems so
Himir Desai: Everyone in my friend circle is dumb so i have you thats a plus point
Ritvick Pandey: yes same before bits talking to u about the haircut was a relief
Ritvick Pandey: people ka opinions are so stupid
Ritvick Pandey: and they dont understand the importance of a good haircut
Ritvick Pandey: chal im off to sleep
Himir Desai: Ha me too

Ritvick Pandey: this one isn’t optional na
Ritvick Pandey: so we’ll have to do anyway
Ritvick Pandey: this one i’m looking forward to writing
Ritvick Pandey: see I will write this
Ritvick Pandey: but if my ans gets too controvsialo
Ritvick Pandey: and comes off as not good
Ritvick Pandey: then ill leave it\
Himir Desai: Ha because if you are supposed to write something that suffers social penalty then what if the application reviewer doest like it
Ritvick Pandey: exavtly
Ritvick Pandey: like what if I write caste system is good and reviewer is a sc/st
Himir Desai: will this be reviewed by an indian
Ritvick Pandey: I dont think so
Ritvick Pandey: but I was just giving an example
Ritvick Pandey: im not going to write about caste system even if it isnt wtf
Himir Desai: okay
Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭
Ritvick Pandey: yes
Ritvick Pandey: ill mostly write
Ritvick Pandey: on hwo I think its ok for some people to rule the world
Ritvick Pandey: and how retards
Ritvick Pandey: are meant to be ruled
Ritvick Pandey: and they should accept it
Ritvick Pandey: but again if it comes off
Ritvick Pandey: too aggressively
Ritvick Pandey: then I wont submit it
Himir Desai: this atlas thing is like team wala to one person ruling would be against the main principal
Ritvick Pandey: yeah thats
Ritvick Pandey: a problem
Ritvick Pandey: but bro this is such a big problem
Ritvick Pandey: people like you and I
Ritvick Pandey: could be ruling everyone around us
Ritvick Pandey: but we cant
Ritvick Pandey: because the nenuas of the world
Ritvick Pandey: are so many in number
Ritvick Pandey: that they can come together and take us down
Ritvick Pandey: which is why I cant ever express what im saying
Himir Desai: ye UN is very faltu
Ritvick Pandey: because for the 1 of me theres 1000000 of them
Ritvick Pandey: what Im thinking*
Ritvick Pandey: technically
Ritvick Pandey: im proposing a team
Ritvick Pandey: of smart people
Ritvick Pandey: but yes I cant just do that
Ritvick Pandey: toh mujhe skip karna padega
Ritvick Pandey: or if I think of something ill lyk
Ritvick Pandey: but imagine
Ritvick Pandey: how much we could achieve
Ritvick Pandey: if people were cclasified based on intelligence
Himir Desai: ha abhi I cant get anything in mind to if I forcefully think it will not turn out to  be good
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: thats what
Ritvick Pandey: this is the only thing I can think of
Ritvick Pandey: which obviously I cant submit
Himir Desai: they are but the intelligence testing process is ghatia
Ritvick Pandey: they arent
Ritvick Pandey: even if you are lets say
Ritvick Pandey: considered
Ritvick Pandey: very intellegent
Ritvick Pandey: you dont get a personal set of dumbfucks
Ritvick Pandey: to help you out
Ritvick Pandey: the dumbfucks
Ritvick Pandey: are treated
Ritvick Pandey: the same
Ritvick Pandey: basically im saying there should be a caste system based on intellegence
Ritvick Pandey: that way the upper most people have the power
Ritvick Pandey: to do whatever
Ritvick Pandey: and take away power from the dfs
Himir Desai: instead of all this I should just dream on college life
Ritvick Pandey: haan that would be
Ritvick Pandey: more beneficial
Ritvick Pandey: this will just

Ritvick Pandey: 25-30
Ritvick Pandey: not in our fucking
Ritvick Pandey: 18-25
Ritvick Pandey: 18-25 is to PARTY
Himir Desai: Array i didnt say i will get married instantly like after college i will do some job then masters tab tak i will have like what some 5-6 girls one at a time
Ritvick Pandey: On a serious note, about the society bullying for being rich spoilt kids, and us getting deported for such reasons is why i was actually considering not applying at all. But I dont want to go to IIT and theres no other option in India
Ritvick Pandey: warna id actually prefer
Ritvick Pandey: in india
Ritvick Pandey: if there was such an option
Ritvick Pandey: but there is not
Ritvick Pandey: one good thing about India is everyone does way too much hardwork and works like a labourer which is something i need to do in college
Ritvick Pandey: and im pretty sure ill get atleast a little laid back in US
Ritvick Pandey: but again india has no colleges
Himir Desai: Ha but when do you get targeted by the senior bullies if you are either popular ya phir you are some random person walking on the road as a non existent being. I would be neither. I do like popularly i am the most popular in school but i am also getting bored with that now
Ritvick Pandey: are you talking about usa or india
Ritvick Pandey: for being targeted by seniors
Ritvick Pandey: In USA seniors cant do fuckall to me
Himir Desai: Thats what i am saying when you go to us everyone will be laid back but i will still be an indian soul and do all the hardwork and maja as well but not like in 100s
Ritvick Pandey: if theyre in a prestigious college ( which is how theyll be my seniors ) no senior will even think of fuckings hooting me and all
Ritvick Pandey: so max they can do is come fight
Himir Desai: I am talking about usa and i dont know who bullies to i said seniors but whoever bullies unka targer
Ritvick Pandey: now again, prestigious college so itll just be a bunch of skinny nerds
Ritvick Pandey: even if they arent
Ritvick Pandey: theyll be
Ritvick Pandey: strong gym people
Ritvick Pandey: but no one will be a gangster
Ritvick Pandey: and if ive learned how to fight which i will
Ritvick Pandey: then im pretty sure i can take on 2-3 seniors
Ritvick Pandey: in india however
Ritvick Pandey: koi bhi goli mar ke chale jayega
Ritvick Pandey: i took boxing classes jan- feb but now i had to quit because of lack of time💔
Himir Desai: Ha and in usa noone cares about others to my only job would be to be out lf bullies ka sight and in that time get enough buffed ki if they come ij my sight i can intimidate them enough
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: in India
Ritvick Pandey: tehyllb
Ritvick Pandey: break down ur hsotel door
Ritvick Pandey: shoot you
Ritvick Pandey: and run awya
Himir Desai: I never needed to fight in my life
Ritvick Pandey: in usa its chill
Ritvick Pandey: worst case itll be
Ritvick Pandey: getitng punched
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: acutally once
Ritvick Pandey: when i got jumped
Ritvick Pandey: but i couldnt rlly fight they had knives
Himir Desai: IITs mai bhi?
Ritvick Pandey: so i just sort of gave up like fuck it
Ritvick Pandey: ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: well not in an IIT
Himir Desai: BITS ke people seemed chill and baki sab colleges are faltu
Ritvick Pandey: its unheard of
Ritvick Pandey: in IIT
Ritvick Pandey: even if u murder someone
Ritvick Pandey: police cant enter the campus
Ritvick Pandey: without taking
Ritvick Pandey: iit ke director ka permission
Ritvick Pandey: so iit is bascially damn safe
Ritvick Pandey: but iit is in cities like Bombay,delhi kanpur
Ritvick Pandey: so if u pissed off some Kanpur wala guy
Ritvick Pandey: he can call his boys
Ritvick Pandey: and next  time u step out of iit
Ritvick Pandey: theyll kill u
Ritvick Pandey: same in delhi & bombay
Ritvick Pandey: all these
Ritvick Pandey: muslim dons in mumbai
Ritvick Pandey: and rich dads in delhi
Ritvick Pandey: etc
Ritvick Pandey: bits is private college na
Himir Desai: Bhai itna violent thoughts are enough ab i will have to get my mind cool to i am studying chemistry
Ritvick Pandey: so only above average richness wala people are there
Ritvick Pandey: nahi but
Ritvick Pandey: none of tha twill happen
Ritvick Pandey: with a person like u
Ritvick Pandey: ur damn nice
Ritvick Pandey: and u wouldnt
Ritvick Pandey: unneccesarily
Ritvick Pandey: fuck with someone
Ritvick Pandey: or be in such a position
Ritvick Pandey: like if we went
Ritvick Pandey: to iitb
Ritvick Pandey: we wouldnt go to the
Ritvick Pandey: slum area
Ritvick Pandey: and fuck with muslims no
Ritvick Pandey: so its a very unlikely case
Ritvick Pandey: whatever i said is assuming
Ritvick Pandey: someone is already after u
Ritvick Pandey: but its very unlikely that someone will be after u
Ritvick Pandey: u as in anyone in general
Himir Desai: Shukria ab mai aram se so paunga
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO
Ritvick Pandey: nahi sahi mai
Ritvick Pandey: if u go to a place such as iit
Ritvick Pandey: u wont counter such people
Himir Desai: (Wese i would have forgotten ye sab in like 5 minutes)
Ritvick Pandey: unless ofcourse u go to some shady ass place
Ritvick Pandey: where i will take you ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: but not shady as in slums
Ritvick Pandey: some rich club
Ritvick Pandey: were some
Ritvick Pandey: rich dad ka beta will get anrgy
Ritvick Pandey: that we took his girl

Ritvick Pandey: I wanted to text u about it but I couldnt find the yt short where I first heard about the book so I was looking for it I just found it
Ritvick Pandey: https://youtube.com/shorts/YGzXx9PhdNc?feature=share
Ritvick Pandey: so I see this short
Ritvick Pandey: and obviously the book catches my interest
Ritvick Pandey: then I go online
Ritvick Pandey: great fucking reviews
Ritvick Pandey: now I told u my dad has all books na
Ritvick Pandey: so I asked my dad if he had it
Ritvick Pandey: and he said yes
Ritvick Pandey: so I took the book from his library
Ritvick Pandey: and my dad said I dont think you should read it
Ritvick Pandey: i just got it sometime back i havent read it either cause your sister told me not to read it
Ritvick Pandey: i said wdym didi told u not to
Ritvick Pandey: then i texted my sister
Ritvick Pandey: she said u wont be able to appreciate it and all
Ritvick Pandey: but then she called my dad and said whyd u give him that book hell become even worse and all that
Ritvick Pandey: BASICALLY theres a LOT of hype over this book
Ritvick Pandey: which i havent seen before
Ritvick Pandey: well i have a little but not this much
Ritvick Pandey: anyways i thought ill lyk since you wanted to start reading again too
Ritvick Pandey: half the people say read it
Ritvick Pandey: half the people say "dont read it at all/The book SHOULD be read. It describes perfectly how narcissists/psychopaths operate and move. Use the book as a SHIELD not a SWORD."
Ritvick Pandey: basically half say read it
Ritvick Pandey: other half say read it so u can understand how other people act so u can save urself from getting fucked over
Ritvick Pandey: 50% says ull learn to fuck over people 50% says ull learn how to avoid being fucked over
Ritvick Pandey: both are good things to learn id say
Ritvick Pandey: the author says if you dont want a fuckton of  power then dont read it, warna you will crave power after reading it
Ritvick Pandey: im so excited to start it
Himir Desai: This book sounds like some dark magic book
Himir Desai: So are you going to read it regardless of everyone saying no
Himir Desai: And you will use it as a sword if i know you well
Himir Desai: Tell me of you do finish it and if you do dont test the sword on me
Ritvick Pandey: thats what I thought
Himir Desai: And for me if i will read or not meh i dont know i have like finished very less books like 8-9 IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. So will be difficult for me
Ritvick Pandey: but its not some kaala jadu or evil spirit bs
Ritvick Pandey: ofcourse not
Ritvick Pandey: theres a certain level of bond after which I dont
Ritvick Pandey: do shit
Ritvick Pandey: with people
Ritvick Pandey: do shit as in
Ritvick Pandey: exploit them
Ritvick Pandey: you have crossed that level which is why I wont test anything on you
Ritvick Pandey: ill let you know if its a good book or not
Himir Desai: Sure and ofc i am also always power hungry
Ritvick Pandey: haan same
Ritvick Pandey: if we dont count

Ritvick Pandey: ya uh wtf
Ritvick Pandey: why are bahar wale log considered genius' for getting 5s then
Himir Desai: 12th ncert i am talking about not 10th wala
Ritvick Pandey: i saw, in mechanics we only need 48% to get a 5
Ritvick Pandey: we can skip the entire free response section
Ritvick Pandey: and still get a 5
Himir Desai: Ha thats why i am not stressing out about starting to prep for chem yesterday

Himir Desai: IELTS is even easier than SAT to wont be an issue
Ritvick Pandey: how many colleges will u apply to
Ritvick Pandey: in the US
Ritvick Pandey: roughly
Himir Desai: 10 maybe idk 7-8 minimum
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: ruk let me guess
Ritvick Pandey: MIT
tanford: tanford
altech: altech
erkeley: erkeley
ornell: ornell
eorgia tech: eorgia tech
Ritvick Pandey: these from US
Himir Desai: Ha ye sab to karunga hi first 3 dream next 2 reach and last wala safety
Himir Desai: And why did this qsys wale fuckers sent the decision to just 1 student early ya phir he is that much confidence ki he will get through the application
Ritvick Pandey: PMFAO
Ritvick Pandey: nahi yaar
Ritvick Pandey: no one can be that confident
Ritvick Pandey: they’re probably sending it in order of application
Ritvick Pandey: chronological order of application
Ritvick Pandey: whoever applied first gets result first
Ritvick Pandey: he must have applied 6 months ago itself
Himir Desai: Its not rolling to they will have eneryones decision together so they just have to do one mail merge
Ritvick Pandey: na they haven’t given
Ritvick Pandey: a day na
Ritvick Pandey: that everyone will get on this day
Ritvick Pandey: they’ve said everyone will get BY this day
Ritvick Pandey: hence they’re probably doing this
Ritvick Pandey: agar ye hota then we should’ve got na
Himir Desai: Achha thik and i am confident ki we will get through atlas ka first stage because a friend of mine with no ecs and no standardised test and no olympiads got through
Himir Desai: Wahi to is problematic
Ritvick Pandey: aisa kya
Ritvick Pandey: i still didn’t get time to submit yaar i’ll do it today
Himir Desai: They are givjng decision in 3-4 days
Ritvick Pandey: i had to prep for mere sir ka ek exam
Himir Desai: After submitting
Ritvick Pandey: oh sexy
Ritvick Pandey: what is round 2?
Himir Desai: The same type of thing but more interesting questions and more character limit
Himir Desai: 1000 characters
Ritvick Pandey: i have feeling we have
Ritvick Pandey: a better than good shot at atlas wala
Himir Desai: Ha
Ritvick Pandey: yaar!
Ritvick Pandey: i’m scared these qs will get me in trouble
Ritvick Pandey: it’s so tempting to write certain answers
Ritvick Pandey: but i can’t for the sake of getting selected
Himir Desai: Bhai i will write some exaggerated thing
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe BS bhi nahi karna
Ritvick Pandey: but i’ll have to
Himir Desai: Ha and i had that friend ke all answers ki usne kya select kara and his answers are less accurate than mine like mere 10 sahi ho to uske 8-9 hi
Ritvick Pandey: kaise gawar friends hai
Ritvick Pandey: anyways if he got selected then it’s chill
Ritvick Pandey: i just googled atlas application on phone
Ritvick Pandey: to open up the site
Ritvick Pandey: and a reddit group and all came up
Ritvick Pandey: where people are discussing answers
Himir Desai: Ha but remember ki atlas mai ek question hai ki how to reduce cheating and usme ek option tha ki plant wrong answers on all popular websites
Himir Desai: It was a multiple correct type question
Ritvick Pandey: i know
Ritvick Pandey: i’m thinking of that only
Ritvick Pandey: it’s not like any smart person is going to check the gc anyway i wouldn’t trust anyone’s answer
Himir Desai: If they are giving $10K to upto 100 students they are very very smarter than normal population
Ritvick Pandey: haan exactly
Ritvick Pandey: plus it’ll get harder to cheat round by round of course
Ritvick Pandey: which is why i’m sure we have a good
Ritvick Pandey: a better than good shot at it
Himir Desai: Is the final round wo interview wala because if yes then we would get 1000 for that
Himir Desai: Just to reach the interview round we get $1000
Himir Desai: If that is the final round which ig it is
Ritvick Pandey: hi
Ritvick Pandey: correct
Ritvick Pandey: I just checked
Ritvick Pandey: 2 written rounds
Ritvick Pandey: and 1-2 interviews
Ritvick Pandey: so interview is final round
Ritvick Pandey: upto 100 get 10k upto 100 get 1k
Ritvick Pandey: so all who make to interview (upto 100) get 1k im guessing
Ritvick Pandey: out of those a select will be in the actual program
Himir Desai: Ha interview bhi 30-60 minute ka hai to pata nahi kya hoga
Ritvick Pandey: ill toh be going after u
Ritvick Pandey: if ur friend passes well both be going after him
Ritvick Pandey: so we should have a basic idea of whats going to happen
Himir Desai: If it is this logical reasoning wala interview then i will ace if its ye essay type wala then i will face issue kyuki on the spot jo dimag mai aata wo curated answer se bakwas hi hota
Himir Desai: I dont think
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: i dont think it will be logical reason wala interview im afraid
Ritvick Pandey: what im thinking is
Ritvick Pandey: theyll probably ask us
Ritvick Pandey: projects weve done
Ritvick Pandey: to help the world
Ritvick Pandey: and how the funding would help us
Ritvick Pandey: theyll definitely ask this one question
Ritvick Pandey: and they might ask stuff like what motivates you and all, basically im guessing essay wale questions
Himir Desai: The are not funding us this is a fellowship scholarship its apna paisa
Himir Desai: they*
Ritvick Pandey: wtf
Ritvick Pandey: isnt a scholarship
Ritvick Pandey: them funding
Himir Desai: ??
Himir Desai: College ke liye and future goals ke liye paise denge not for doing some project
Ritvick Pandey: bro what
Ritvick Pandey: set
Ritvick Pandey: wtf
Ritvick Pandey: what will i do
Ritvick Pandey: with 1k usd
Ritvick Pandey: for college
Ritvick Pandey: i thought this was some group for students to make change so theyll tell us to think of shit and then fund it
Ritvick Pandey: set
Ritvick Pandey: that is dissappointing
Himir Desai: What is bayes theorem
Himir Desai: Ha to this is good or bad i cant get your tone from the msg
Ritvick Pandey: accha its two different things
Ritvick Pandey: i had read just this earlier
Ritvick Pandey: but dekh project equipment also
Ritvick Pandey: arrey remember i told u that one q is mindfuck
Ritvick Pandey: probability wala
Ritvick Pandey: cuase i dont like probability
Ritvick Pandey: it was easy if u used
Ritvick Pandey: bayes theorem
Himir Desai: Konsa wala that traffic jam?
Ritvick Pandey: but i thought they wont use
Ritvick Pandey: bayes theorem
Ritvick Pandey: cause gore kids are gaawar
Ritvick Pandey: but if they mentioned it in home page they probably did use it
Ritvick Pandey: tujhe theorem pata hoga u just dont know the name
Ritvick Pandey: basically find
Ritvick Pandey: probability of some event Y
Himir Desai: Ala ye bayes theorem is common sense wearing a coat blazer and trousers
Ritvick Pandey: if event X has taken place
Ritvick Pandey: 🤣🤣🤣
Ritvick Pandey: ur slang is mast ekdum
Ritvick Pandey: i forgot yaar kaunsa
Himir Desai: Jisme there were 3 flavors of jam
Ritvick Pandey: i just skipped past it cause it was probability
Ritvick Pandey: and i absolutely hate PnC and probability
Ritvick Pandey: it was that golden ticket wala
Ritvick Pandey: teacher has golden ticket
Himir Desai: Strawberry cheery wo wala
Ritvick Pandey: nahi not jam
Ritvick Pandey: jam wala was so easy
Ritvick Pandey: golden ticket
Himir Desai: Achha uska to 80%
Ritvick Pandey: haan i got 80 i think
Ritvick Pandey: but i used bayes theorem
Ritvick Pandey: and got 18
Ritvick Pandey: or something like that
Ritvick Pandey: pata nahi i forgot
Ritvick Pandey: ill do tonight and text
Ritvick Pandey: no wait
Ritvick Pandey: i got
Ritvick Pandey: 20 something
Ritvick Pandey: and 80 was
Ritvick Pandey: given ni question
Ritvick Pandey: idk bro i dont remember ill do the question and tell u
Himir Desai: Nahi bayes theorem wont be applicable here because the remaining 15 chocolates were just decoys we know ki usme nahi hai for sure so probability is not equl for all chocolates to bayes theorem not applicable uske liye you need equal probability for pura sample set
Ritvick Pandey: wtf yaar
Ritvick Pandey: leave i cant be bothered
Ritvick Pandey: bas wahi question karna hai
Ritvick Pandey: ill sit it with for 10mins toh ho jayega
Ritvick Pandey: i despise pnc
Ritvick Pandey: and probability
Himir Desai: Ha try jitna hard you want and then if you are just like get lost ye question then enter 80 as answer
Ritvick Pandey: na u cant just
Ritvick Pandey: consider ki we knew the other 15 are decoy na
Ritvick Pandey: hume still calculate to karna hoga
Ritvick Pandey: pata nahi bro leave ill try it
Ritvick Pandey: and text u
Himir Desai: Ha you try but i am damn sure its 80
Himir Desai: We know kyuki it is given in question that none of the other students have got the ticket
Ritvick Pandey: hello
Ritvick Pandey: bayes theorem
Ritvick Pandey: will work here
Ritvick Pandey: and using it we will get 0.8
Ritvick Pandey: toh ur answer is correct
Himir Desai: I to just eye balled the question i adore pnc and probability
Ritvick Pandey: i KNEW youd be the typa person to like it
Ritvick Pandey: anyway why do u say bayes theorem is not applicable tho i didnt understand
Ritvick Pandey: i used it and i got 0.8
Ritvick Pandey: 0.8 as in 80%
Ritvick Pandey: not 0.8%
Himir Desai: Not bayes theorem but many people would just do 1/16*4/5 which is not correct
Himir Desai: Bayes correct ho sakta
Ritvick Pandey: haan bayes iske liye hi hai
Himir Desai: Achha but mai koi bhi theorem ke naam yaad nai karta except L’Hôpital jisme i correct everytime when sir says L Hospital
Ritvick Pandey: haan same
Ritvick Pandey: when i couldnt do the question i went through my book for probabilty
Ritvick Pandey: cause i knew the theorem but i forgot what it was
Ritvick Pandey: then i saw bayes theorem
Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO SAME
Ritvick Pandey: MY SCHOOL TEACHER KEEPS SAYING hospital

Ritvick Pandey: Hey Ritvick,
: 
 think there are pros and cons to excluding your scores from your application. If you believe it will hurt your application, I would suggest not submitting your class 11 scores since you would be at peace with how your application looks on paper. If I'm not mistaken, the school counselor doesn't have to submit scores on your behalf for UC Applications, so you wouldn't have to worry about including it in your application.: think there are pros and cons to excluding your scores from your application.

owever, if I were in your position, I would probably include my scores, and explain what happened during the academic year that led to a drop in my performance (I believe there is a section for additional comments). From what I've heard, colleges look at your class 11 scores and your predicted scores from class 12 the most while making their decisions. If they don't see any scores from class 11, they might not take your application as seriously as we would hope they would.: owever, if I were in your position, I would probably include my scores, and explain what happened during the academic year that led to a drop in my performance (I believe there is a section for additional comments).

he college admissions process in the US has been and always will be a mystery.

ith that being said, I think the decision is ultimately in your hands. After having looked at your LinkedIn, I think you have a strong application regardless of your class 11 scores. I hope colleges see you for the student you are outside of the classroom as well.: ith that being said, I think the decision is ultimately in your hands.

Ritvick Pandey: One successful example of using memes in marketing is the fast-food chain Wendy's. Wendy's has become well-known for its witty and sarcastic social media presence, using memes and clever comebacks to engage with customers online. In 2017, Wendy's responded to a Twitter user's request for a year's supply of chicken nuggets with a challenge to get 18 million retweets. The exchange went viral and became the most retweeted tweet of all time, earning Wendy's millions of impressions and a significant boost in brand awareness.

Ritvick Pandey: Guerrilla marketing is all about thinking outside the box, and finding creative ways to get your message in front of your target audience.
: 
ne great example of guerrilla marketing is the famous "Red Bull Stratos" campaign. You may remember this as the time Felix Baumgartner jumped from a helium balloon at the edge of space. The stunt was broadcast live online, and it generated millions of views, making it one of the most successful marketing campaigns in history.: ne great example of guerrilla marketing is the famous "Red Bull Stratos" campaign.

Himir Desai: Bhai this second stage ka application is freaking huge there are videos to learn things from and answer questions accordingly
Himir Desai: And probability seems like a big part of this application

Ritvick Pandey: id just rather not do it
Ritvick Pandey: but its fne

Ritvick Pandey: even tho uoft ranks much higher
Himir Desai: 16th May

Himir Desai: Kyuki waterloo gives some co-op program i guess and waterloo is cheaper to live in and other reasons i dont know
Himir Desai: Like companies mai what reputation i dont know

Himir Desai: Achha but Waterloo mai to admission ho hi jana chahiye like MIT se to easy hi hi
Himir Desai: hai*
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Himir Desai: Ha but abhi tak QSYS ka nahi aaya
Ritvick Pandey: bro
Ritvick Pandey: the more the days pass by
Ritvick Pandey: the more im realising JEE is my only option
Ritvick Pandey: and im only delaying focusing on it
Ritvick Pandey: ill have to see UCAS ka form
Ritvick Pandey: if only predicted scores are required then I can still get somewhat of a shot
Ritvick Pandey: also, if we do undergrad at oxford (atleast for engineering) then after 4 years we wont get a bachelor
Ritvick Pandey: bachelors* degree
Ritvick Pandey: but a masters
Ritvick Pandey: thats sick
Himir Desai: We wont get or we wont just get
Ritvick Pandey: wont get
Ritvick Pandey: well get a masters
Ritvick Pandey: not masters + bachelors
Himir Desai: Hein
Himir Desai: What
Himir Desai: Allen wale credit puri le jate but publicly bhi ho jati
Himir Desai: And I understand why they said upto 29 other fellows because there are 2-4 cohorts depending on how many qualified students are there
Himir Desai: So minimum 60 will get selected
Himir Desai: Bhai atlas mai apply kar diya?
Ritvick Pandey: nahi yaar
Ritvick Pandey: bola na aaj kardunga

Himir Desai: I just have to use this tomorrow
Ritvick Pandey: wont the brush pens leak through the paper

Ritvick Pandey: it got blurry cause camera has water
Ritvick Pandey: but they’re pretty
Ritvick Pandey: SAME
Ritvick Pandey: i had to get a binder wala notebook
Ritvick Pandey: so it’s not visible that i  tear pages
Ritvick Pandey: if i mess up the heading i tear that page and start new
Ritvick Pandey: and use the torn page for rough work
Himir Desai: Ha i am using them from 2 years
Himir Desai: No i just crumble it and throw away
Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO SAME
Ritvick Pandey: i said

Himir Desai: AI tha ki self written
Ritvick Pandey: AI ofcourse I woudlnt waste my time writing it
Ritvick Pandey: i self wrote one
Ritvick Pandey: but it didnt sound as good
Ritvick Pandey: I'm forced to strongly discourage you from taking the suggested course of action because it doesn't seem to be based on solid judgement or wisdom. I must categorically state that such a plan is foolish since, in my opinion, it would be full of possible hazards and negative effects.
Ritvick Pandey: i wrote this
Ritvick Pandey: and asked chatgpt to make it sound really complex
Ritvick Pandey: anyway lets not waste time on that stupid fuck
Himir Desai: Ha leave that
Ritvick Pandey: do you want to join this gc

Ritvick Pandey: now this would be helpful if we were looking for experienced designers ( which we will be once we start workingon pg4u)
Himir Desai: Hmm i dont know what to say. True?
Himir Desai: Like True bol ke chhod du
Ritvick Pandey: say waah ritvick thats actuall cool

Himir Desai: Mathematics and Computers something like that
Ritvick Pandey: it’s v well known for mech
Ritvick Pandey: indian colleges
Ritvick Pandey: ka engineering books
Ritvick Pandey: are either from purdue or carnegie melon
Ritvick Pandey: mechanical engineering
Himir Desai: Ha but he does not want to go there because everyone from Vadodara goes there
Ritvick Pandey: ya uh wtf
Himir Desai: There is a school Navrachna yaha par puri drug dealers and weso li school kai waha ki ek ladki 7th mai virginity lose kar di thi waha se sab purdue jate

Himir Desai: https://www.linkedin.com/in/swayam-shah-77916b221
Himir Desai: Linkedin profile updated nahi hai shayad
Himir Desai: Soch le yaar
Ritvick Pandey: also
Ritvick Pandey: im surprised imperial only asked for 95%
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe laga itll be higher
Himir Desai: I thought its on the higher side
Ritvick Pandey: but again even after 95 there is another test and interview
Ritvick Pandey: oh
Ritvick Pandey: I was expecting
Ritvick Pandey: for oxford and all
Ritvick Pandey: the conditional offer will be 96-97 minimumm
Ritvick Pandey: aur imperial hai toh they did 95
Ritvick Pandey: if 95 is the cutoff, it makes things a little easier
Himir Desai: That would be deadly they wont ask for that much
Himir Desai: You are underestimating boards ka paper
Ritvick Pandey: hain
Ritvick Pandey: Earlier, Indian students needed to appear for their A-levels ..

Ritvick Pandey: arrey it wont lemme copy
Ritvick Pandey: basically
Ritvick Pandey: even tho this is an old article
Ritvick Pandey: it says 90%
Ritvick Pandey: ya now that I think of it
Ritvick Pandey: a conditional offer of 97 would be too fucked
Ritvick Pandey: 90 is extremely doable though
Ritvick Pandey: also
Ritvick Pandey: NTU is practically impossible
Ritvick Pandey: they only take 1 admit per year
Ritvick Pandey: so 100% will be reuqired
Ritvick Pandey: in boards
Ritvick Pandey: if we wanna go
Ritvick Pandey: and 100% is fucking impossible pretty much
Himir Desai: Ha that is not doable but a necessity if i dont get 90% i will drown in chullubhar pani
Himir Desai: Nahi na it would not be that much 97-98
Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO yeah
Ritvick Pandey: under 90 would be depressing asf
Ritvick Pandey: yaar
Ritvick Pandey: the bhaiya I talked to
Ritvick Pandey: from NTU
Ritvick Pandey: had 100%
Ritvick Pandey: if they only take 1 per year
Ritvick Pandey: definitely the 100% wale log are applying
Ritvick Pandey: that means to get in you also have to be 100%
Himir Desai: And then aaj ap dene gaya tha to i found 2 other students one who is in our grade and one who has passed 12. And it made me realise ki we are taking things too easy. Like wo 12th pass wale bhaiya got into UCSD and UPenn and CMU mai waitlisted
Himir Desai: And he had given 4 APs other ECs i dont know
Ritvick Pandey: no fucking way
Ritvick Pandey: what made u realise were taking things too easy if u dont know the other ECs
Ritvick Pandey: bro lets do something big with pg4u itll boost our application by a lot
Ritvick Pandey: and we can publish research papers
Ritvick Pandey: I found this lab in blr
Ritvick Pandey: CFRCE
Himir Desai: Then jo hamare grade mai hai he to lives in Vadodara and his mother was super helpful. So like he is in IBDP to udhar to everyone applies in US, UK etc. so she gave me the number of a personal mentor like lady who gets like ivy admissions to her students every year
Ritvick Pandey: centre for fundamental research and creative education
Ritvick Pandey: theyll take 4lakh
Ritvick Pandey: but theyll teach me advanced physics
Ritvick Pandey: and I can do research
Ritvick Pandey: one of their student
Ritvick Pandey: students
Ritvick Pandey: went to MIT
Ritvick Pandey: in 10th grade
Ritvick Pandey: 10th fucking grade bro
Himir Desai: For you to it will be easier because you will be applying to mechanical
Ritvick Pandey: he didnt finish highschool also he submitted a letter from CFRCE to mit and they accepted it
Ritvick Pandey: but im not sure if ill do it cause its of no use to me as I have no shot in US anyway (11th scores)
Ritvick Pandey: it wont be easier na
Ritvick Pandey: my 11th scores are fucked up
Himir Desai: Ha that will make things difficult for you in UK also kyuki predicted scores ko hi dekhte to you will have to get them from your school
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe bhi bhejna na woh lady ka number
Ritvick Pandey: no see
Ritvick Pandey: if they are giving conditional offer in 90s
Ritvick Pandey: I can definitely get a predicted score in 90+ if I beg enough
Ritvick Pandey: hopefully atleast
Ritvick Pandey: so atleast UK theres a shot
Ritvick Pandey: cause in midterms and premidterms
Ritvick Pandey: and preboards
Himir Desai: Wo Vadodara mai personal leti hai i will send you but how will she guide you like just phone calls le liye you will pay tens of thousands
Ritvick Pandey: ill have around 95+
Ritvick Pandey: so ill convince my teachers
Himir Desai: UK ke liye iska time nahi hoga oct 16
Ritvick Pandey: mere midterms hogaye honge
Ritvick Pandey: mere premidterms will be in June itself
Himir Desai: Start working after pehla PA gets over last mai bohot gai gai ho jaegi (gujarati for chaos type situation)
Ritvick Pandey: PA?
Himir Desai: You have a pre midterms
Himir Desai: Periodic Assessments tumhare waha unit test
Ritvick Pandey: haan its called Unit tests( UT)
Ritvick Pandey: oh accha
Ritvick Pandey: thats what
Ritvick Pandey: first UT mai chaps are damn easy
Ritvick Pandey: so ill get full in math, physics and I
Ritvick Pandey: AI*
Ritvick Pandey: problem is chem
Ritvick Pandey: my chem is rlly rlly weak
Himir Desai: Konsa chapter hai
Ritvick Pandey: idk if I can sort by june
Ritvick Pandey: pata nahi
Ritvick Pandey: koi block
Ritvick Pandey: d and f block
Ritvick Pandey: and 2 other chaps
Himir Desai: Block chemistry hs been removed by CBSE indefinitely
Ritvick Pandey: physics mai electrostatics which im done wiht
Ritvick Pandey: math mai continuity differentiability and linear algebra
Ritvick Pandey: im done with both
Ritvick Pandey: chem mai idk
Ritvick Pandey: hain
Ritvick Pandey: i attended one school class
Ritvick Pandey: that sir was teaching some bloc
Ritvick Pandey: block*
Himir Desai: They even removed it from printed NCERT books this year
Ritvick Pandey: ya uh wtf
Himir Desai: JEE mains mai bhi nahi aega most probably
Ritvick Pandey: anyway mera USA toh is almost impossible
Ritvick Pandey: i was talking to this girl today
Ritvick Pandey: and i felt so fucked up
Ritvick Pandey: but i dont feel like giving up on US also
Ritvick Pandey: shes economics student
Ritvick Pandey: got into London school of economics, cornell and 2-3 more good colleges
Himir Desai: I am more of leaning towards UK kyuki US is just a 10 year poker game sab kuchh luck par
Ritvick Pandey: i mean same
Ritvick Pandey: but not
Ritvick Pandey: nececesarily
Ritvick Pandey: UK is
Ritvick Pandey: guaranteed shot
Ritvick Pandey: for me
Ritvick Pandey: while US isnt
Ritvick Pandey: as in
Ritvick Pandey: I can still do things
Ritvick Pandey: to get into UK
Ritvick Pandey: which i cant with US
Ritvick Pandey: for ex - PAT, 12th board
Ritvick Pandey: in US its more in bhagwan ke haath
Himir Desai: I was thinking ki i will apply to oxford and imperial then warwick and Edinburgh
Ritvick Pandey: good thing about UK is
Ritvick Pandey: remember how i told u
Ritvick Pandey: ki i might take statistics and get into investment banking
Ritvick Pandey: UK ke good college ke students
Ritvick Pandey: like from Oxbridge imperial and all
Ritvick Pandey: engineering students
Ritvick Pandey: get picked up as investment bankers
Ritvick Pandey: by these firms
Ritvick Pandey: to paisa hi paisa hoga
Ritvick Pandey: I too have thought of oxford imperial and edinburgh
Ritvick Pandey: what made you choose oxford over Cambridge?
Himir Desai: Cambridge is 🤯 difficult
Ritvick Pandey: matlab
Ritvick Pandey: the exam?
Ritvick Pandey: STEP?
Himir Desai: Nahi pura admission process
Ritvick Pandey: how so
Ritvick Pandey: isnt it pretty similar to oxford
Himir Desai: Acceptance i mean
Ritvick Pandey: camrbdige has a better acceptance rate also na
Himir Desai: Better matlab kam ki zyada
Ritvick Pandey: zyada
Ritvick Pandey: cambridge ka is 21%
Ritvick Pandey: oxford is 17.5
Ritvick Pandey: check gc
Ritvick Pandey: accha u checked
Himir Desai: Nahi because less people apply to Cambridge cause more difficult
Ritvick Pandey: i just googled
Ritvick Pandey: oxford ka 24k ppl applied in 2021
Ritvick Pandey: and cambridge "over 22k" applied in 2021
Ritvick Pandey: sabkuch toh seems similar
Ritvick Pandey: plus for cs cambridge is a slight better na
Ritvick Pandey: anyway im glad ur choosing oxford if we both get in itll be masti
Himir Desai: Why were you defending Cambridge
Ritvick Pandey: nahi I wasnt defending
Ritvick Pandey: i just thought its a better fit for you as you match all the criteria
Ritvick Pandey: and the ranking of Cambridge is better for cs
Ritvick Pandey: but i was wrong
Ritvick Pandey: oxfords ranking is better for cs
Ritvick Pandey: rest everythimg im sure is at par between both the universities
Ritvick Pandey: so you choosing oxford is a wise decision
Himir Desai: We are talking as if hamara dono mai admission is guaranteed
Himir Desai: I chose oxford kyuki andar se awaz ai
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO sahi mai
Ritvick Pandey: ill be very disheartened
Ritvick Pandey: if rejection comes at interview stage
Ritvick Pandey: how fuckall would that be
Ritvick Pandey: AYE
Ritvick Pandey: we might to get meet in the interview centre
Ritvick Pandey: mumbai or chennai
Ritvick Pandey: i think those are the 2 in india
Ritvick Pandey: but those are for cambridge
Ritvick Pandey: idk about oxford
Himir Desai: In which month is the interview
Ritvick Pandey: However, interviews are also conducted remotely, for students who cannot travel to the UK to attend their interviews. Oxford conducts interviews via Skype for those who are unable to attend interviews in person. They take place on the same days as all other interviews and follow an identical pattern. Therefore, candidates will normally have two separate interviews, and if there is any preliminary reading to go along with the interview it will usually be e-mailed to your academic referee. It is a misconception to believe that those interviewing over Skype are at a disadvantage as compared to those interviewed in-person,  and should not be a reason to worry for any applicants. If you’re invited to interview at any college, you will be provided with further guidelines for an online interview, which will generally require you to organise that the interview takes place in your current academic institution.
Ritvick Pandey: december
Ritvick Pandey: Cambridge works slightly differently in that instead of having online interviews, it conducts a series of overseas interview schemes. Interviews are conducted in different cities around the world and applicants will have to travel to one of these cities, usually the one closest to them. For 2020 entry, the interviews are likely to take place in 7 cities, including Mumbai, which is where most Indian candidates are likely to be interviewed.
Ritvick Pandey: accha toh if applying to cambrdige
Ritvick Pandey: youll have to go to some city in india
Ritvick Pandey: oxford takes online interview
Ritvick Pandey: "Interviews are mostly conducted in the first 2 weeks of December"
Himir Desai: Just to go Mumbai instead we can meet in London
Ritvick Pandey: no i didnt mean it in such a way
Himir Desai: Heathrow airport is Chumeshwari
Ritvick Pandey: i thought oxford ka would be in mumbai too
Ritvick Pandey: yaar
Ritvick Pandey: i see your point
Ritvick Pandey: oxford ka process
Ritvick Pandey: seems a little bit easier
Ritvick Pandey: compared to cambridge
Ritvick Pandey: While Oxford accepts CBSE and CISCE results by themselves, Cambridge usually accepts them alongside other additional qualifications.
Himir Desai: Other like aps
Ritvick Pandey: 💀💀
Ritvick Pandey: im reading off of this website
Ritvick Pandey: https://doxa.co.uk/undergraduateresources/applying-from-india
Ritvick Pandey: accha bro
Ritvick Pandey: this is badhiya
Ritvick Pandey: A*A*A courses ke liye ( hum dono ka yahi hai )
Himir Desai: Most probably i will do skype wala wasting 2 lakh on tickets in case reject kara would be embarrassing
Ritvick Pandey: on website it said u need A1 in 4 subjects na
Ritvick Pandey: that translates to 91+ in 4 subjects
Ritvick Pandey: i thought a1 would be higher as its percentile wise
Himir Desai: Nahi mera current result to A*A*A* hai
Ritvick Pandey: At Oxford, for courses requiring A*A*A, students with Indian qualifications will be required to achieve 91% or above in 4 out of the 5 papers they sit under CBSE
Ritvick Pandey: ?
Himir Desai: 11th ka
Ritvick Pandey: matlab
Ritvick Pandey: oh
Ritvick Pandey: no this
Ritvick Pandey: a*a*a
Ritvick Pandey: is for
Ritvick Pandey: 12th board
Ritvick Pandey: also wtf
Ritvick Pandey: mere ke liye its A*A*A
Ritvick Pandey: For cs surprsiingily its A*AA
Himir Desai: Wo bhi aa hi jaega agar english mai koi strict checker na ho
Ritvick Pandey: A*A*A is 91+ in 4 subs
Ritvick Pandey: then A*AA
Ritvick Pandey: basiaclly if u get overall 90
Ritvick Pandey: im guessing
Ritvick Pandey: but again
Ritvick Pandey: matching minimum requirements wont help
Ritvick Pandey: itll have to be extra
Ritvick Pandey: are you going to buy any cbse material
Ritvick Pandey: to practice board qs
Ritvick Pandey: matlab when approx will u start english
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: i feel like there is less space for error also in online meeting
Ritvick Pandey: accha ill go sleep goodnight
Himir Desai: Ha
Ritvick Pandey: also sun na
Ritvick Pandey: can u ask that guy who got rejected in 2nd round about his predicted score
Himir Desai: 94%
Himir Desai: Wo mere school mai hi hai
Himir Desai: atlas bhar Diya?
Himir Desai: first stage mai you have to write a total of 4000ish characters second stage mai its 11800 to first mai hi itna time lag gaya to second kese hoga achhi quality se
Himir Desai: wo jo 1590 wala tha he applied to atlas last year uska first stage ho gaya tha and second mai he got rejected to its time to take this seriously
Himir Desai: Aaj I wrote 3200 characters wala kaam and usme ek video dekh kar karne wala tha and ek podcast sunkar karne wala tha
Himir Desai: ab 3000 characters about me wale mai rahe 3000 ye aas paas essays normal and bache hue logical reasoning ke explainations mai
Ritvick Pandey: goddamn wtf
Ritvick Pandey: also good news
Himir Desai: Which uni
Ritvick Pandey: not in any uni
Ritvick Pandey: just one batch over us
Ritvick Pandey: so hes still in admission cycle probably
Ritvick Pandey: also accha listen
Ritvick Pandey: yk why that bhaiyas conditional from imperial was so high
Ritvick Pandey: oxford ka minimum requirements we saw na
Ritvick Pandey: A1 A1 A1 A1 and A2
Ritvick Pandey: imperial ka minimum requirements are higher
Ritvick Pandey: minimum 95 in math and phy
Ritvick Pandey: this is for mech eng
Himir Desai: I think boards mai problem nai hoga kyuki mai 11th finals mai bina koi bhi cheating ke ya setting ke 5 din padh ke 97% le aaya to boards ke liye to mai ek mahine pehle se hi start kar dunga 100% aa jaenge (minus english)
Himir Desai: Ha to i guess wo mere dost ka jo conditional letter hai wo isiliye ki he must have minimum qualifications
Himir Desai: Par waha pe peers would be khatarnak
Himir Desai: Oxford requirements for CBSE is just grades not marks to it is relative to it will be easy just getting that letter will be the problem
Ritvick Pandey: haan I saw
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: EXACTLY
Ritvick Pandey: "dont underestimate boards" - Himir Desai
Ritvick Pandey: wtf
Himir Desai: Thats why i will prepare for a month
Ritvick Pandey: thats a surprisingly low qualification
Ritvick Pandey: for a v good college
Ritvick Pandey: nahi see
Ritvick Pandey: usually
Himir Desai: Ha and i would go open application i have no college preference
Ritvick Pandey: a1 is
Ritvick Pandey: from 91-100
Himir Desai: In CBSE it is >90 percentile
Ritvick Pandey: only for AI its not
Ritvick Pandey: nahi I meant
Ritvick Pandey: 91-100
Ritvick Pandey: in math sci and all
Ritvick Pandey: is guaranteed a1 most of the years
Ritvick Pandey: 91 percent
Ritvick Pandey: ^
Ritvick Pandey: only not for optional subject
Ritvick Pandey: cause in optional subject the avg percentile is v high
Ritvick Pandey: so even 96% (my friend got ) is a2
Himir Desai: Which subject
Ritvick Pandey: AI
Ritvick Pandey: class X
Himir Desai: Thats what i am sayings its percentile based if there are less students in that course less will get A1
Ritvick Pandey: arrey
Ritvick Pandey: but im saying
Himir Desai: I cant wait yaar i want to apply right now and get a decision
Ritvick Pandey: in PCM 90+ percent is almost everytime a1 s
Ritvick Pandey: i know its percentile wise
Ritvick Pandey: but 90 percent is a1
Ritvick Pandey: since the last few years
Ritvick Pandey: means 90% is still in top percentile
Ritvick Pandey: hence a1 wont be that difficult
Ritvick Pandey: SAME
Himir Desai: Ha it wont be
Ritvick Pandey: i was thinking this exact thing some time ago
Ritvick Pandey: im too excited
Ritvick Pandey: i cant wait to write
Ritvick Pandey: PAT
Ritvick Pandey: and get
Ritvick Pandey: interviewed
Ritvick Pandey: itll be masti
Himir Desai: I will also apply to some other program like Oxford mai i will apply to 2 and imperial mai 1-2 maybe and Edinburgh wont be much difficult to total its 5
Ritvick Pandey: badhiya
Ritvick Pandey: sexy
Ritvick Pandey: news
Ritvick Pandey: bhi aagayi
Himir Desai: So second course i will do maybe koi pure science ya kuchh
Ritvick Pandey: i saw an option on ICL ka website saying chat with our student
Ritvick Pandey: i found an indian icse wali and messaged
Himir Desai: ICL ka full form kya hai Imperial?

Ritvick Pandey: were the same person bro wtf
Ritvick Pandey: under my interest form
Ritvick Pandey: i have put
Ritvick Pandey: mechanical engineering as 1
Ritvick Pandey: and 2nd as physics
Himir Desai: You know what all the teachers in my school expect me to be gujarat ka topper with 99% marks
Ritvick Pandey: even i was thinking second course pure science ya kuch lunga
Himir Desai: Aaj one teacher was introducing me to 2-3 other teachers
Ritvick Pandey: isnt it 5 different universities
Ritvick Pandey: and not 5 different courses
Himir Desai: Today my physics sir told about research mai future so i thought maine to ye kabhi explore hi nai kara
Himir Desai: I dont know i am saying worse case
Ritvick Pandey: nothing specific is coming up
Ritvick Pandey: but mostly
Ritvick Pandey: u can apply to n number of courses
Ritvick Pandey: in one university
Ritvick Pandey: and a total of 5 universities
Ritvick Pandey: ARREY SAME
Ritvick Pandey: nottoday
Ritvick Pandey: but last week
Ritvick Pandey: my sir told be about his time at ETH zurich
Ritvick Pandey: so i started thinking
Ritvick Pandey: waah
Ritvick Pandey: kya boli
Himir Desai: And that teacher doesnt even teach me
Ritvick Pandey: nevermind on some quora answer it says one course takes up 1 spot out of 5
Ritvick Pandey: hain
Ritvick Pandey: waah
Ritvick Pandey: ur that famous uh
Ritvick Pandey: tu aaj kal school kyu ja raha hai
Ritvick Pandey: dummy hai na
Himir Desai: Aaj school mai maja aa gaya i am an IP student to i cant play outdoors like i can but not during other periods but this one sir jo PE ke hai unhe pata liya and i bunked physics ka class and played basketball
Himir Desai: Fridays and Saturdays
Ritvick Pandey: arrey sexy
Ritvick Pandey: i have also made setting with school ke hockey coach
Ritvick Pandey: whenever im bukning in ground and a teacher catches me
Ritvick Pandey: woh sir says that i am training for zonal match with the rest of his team

Ritvick Pandey: basically sabkuch hai
Himir Desai: Hamare waha just basketball football cricket volleyball badminton and yeah thats it
Ritvick Pandey: YAAR I CANT FUKIEN WAITBSEJDFNSJDGNSJDB
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: also suno
Himir Desai: SAMEJENRHRUS
Ritvick Pandey: the 2 courses u apply to
Ritvick Pandey: must be similar na
Ritvick Pandey: as UCAS ka
Ritvick Pandey: same esay
Ritvick Pandey: goes to all 5 unis
Ritvick Pandey: and in ur essay u have to show ur passion for ur subject
Ritvick Pandey: like mine is mech
Ritvick Pandey: so me showinh physics interest
Ritvick Pandey: helps both mech course and physics course
Ritvick Pandey: in cs ull have cs math and physics to show
Ritvick Pandey: i mean im assuming ur choosing physics in pure science
Ritvick Pandey: but wtvr u choose
Ritvick Pandey: u get my point na
Himir Desai: I will sort something out writing wont be an issue
Himir Desai: Sorry my phone battery died to wait karna pada
Himir Desai: Idk there are lots of courses available i may do some mix maths and data science sometimes
Himir Desai: Something*
Ritvick Pandey: yaar
Ritvick Pandey: in imperial there is AI
Ritvick Pandey: which im tending towards
Ritvick Pandey: but im not too sure
Ritvick Pandey: accha also
Ritvick Pandey: i realised this one teacher
Ritvick Pandey: MATH HOD
Ritvick Pandey: she lieks me a lot
Ritvick Pandey: cause i only always win math competitions for our school na
Ritvick Pandey: and i just got to know
Ritvick Pandey: shes the academic counselor as well
Ritvick Pandey: so pataoing her for predicted marks shouldn't be that hrad
Himir Desai: I thought of that but wouldnt it limit future prospects
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: thats my issue too
Ritvick Pandey: which is why i said im not too sure
Ritvick Pandey: but the problem it
Ritvick Pandey: is
Ritvick Pandey: it also opens up a lot of cool prospects
Himir Desai: Even in our school the math head is the coordinator (counselor nai hai koi)
Ritvick Pandey: but again i can learn AI in depth post my undergrad
Himir Desai: Eggzactly
Ritvick Pandey: but i cant learn engineering post AI
Ritvick Pandey: yeah
Ritvick Pandey: also
Himir Desai: UK mai one more useless problem it rains throughout the year
Ritvick Pandey: will u write UTs this year or skip like 10th
Ritvick Pandey: ull write it na, as well have to show to our colleges in UK mostly
Himir Desai: I will ofcourse write them
Ritvick Pandey: accha ok
Ritvick Pandey: that is a huge problem!
Himir Desai: In 10th i skipped because i had OCSC
Ritvick Pandey: remember when we first spoke
Ritvick Pandey: i told about my
Ritvick Pandey: issue with uk
Ritvick Pandey: its tooo dperessing
Ritvick Pandey: its always gloomy gloomy
Ritvick Pandey: i just talked to my dad about Imperial
Ritvick Pandey: he said london mai only 4 months of sunlight aati hai
Ritvick Pandey: itna depressing mahol hai
Himir Desai: Nahi itni kam to arctic mai bhi nahi hoti
Ritvick Pandey: the architecture is so pretty, but the area overall is so gloomy. I feel like if i get into any of my depression stages itll peak in UK due to the environment
Ritvick Pandey: its all so grey
Ritvick Pandey: so colourless
Ritvick Pandey: nahi
Ritvick Pandey: i highly doubt my father is wrong
Ritvick Pandey: by no sunlight he obviously doenst mean sun doesnt come only like the artic
Ritvick Pandey: There are 1,675 hours of sunshine every year in London. From November to February, the sun is rarely visible, but from May to August, it shines for an appropriate amount of hours, and in any case, it shines a little more frequently than the rest of Britain (excluding the southern coast).
Ritvick Pandey: haan may to august roughly 4 months including others i guess
Himir Desai: After going there wont be much depresion jo hoga wo temporary exam ke ek din pehle hoga bas
Ritvick Pandey: bro wtf - "In 2019 London had 63 days on which there were no recorded sunshine hours"
Ritvick Pandey: thats another thing im afraid of
Ritvick Pandey: lack of social life
Ritvick Pandey: whchim looking forward to for college
Himir Desai: Oxford london mai nahi hai
Ritvick Pandey: but in oxford for some reason i have a feeling
Ritvick Pandey: i wont talk to many ppl
Himir Desai: There wont be a lack i guess atleast current se to zyada hi hogi
Ritvick Pandey: current se to bahut zyada hogi
Ritvick Pandey: casue current is 0
Ritvick Pandey: but not what i expected from college
Ritvick Pandey: yk masti party warty etc
Ritvick Pandey: i feel like at UK ill be a lot more serious
Ritvick Pandey: will be forced to be a lot more serious^
Ritvick Pandey: but USA will be so masti
Ritvick Pandey: ik
Ritvick Pandey: oxford is equally gloomy
Ritvick Pandey: BROOOOOOOO
Ritvick Pandey: Scotland is toooooo prettyy
Ritvick Pandey: its like UK architecture
Ritvick Pandey: but sm better weather
Himir Desai: From my heart i want to go to Edinburgh even if i get into oxford
Ritvick Pandey: but the issue is - college isnt as good
Himir Desai: Wahi problem
Ritvick Pandey: fuck it well go to Edinburgh or what
Himir Desai: University of Edinburgh is #15 AA
Ritvick Pandey: we have a good shot at it also ( boards isnt diffciualt  )
Himir Desai: QS*
Ritvick Pandey: but actually its not good enough bro
Ritvick Pandey: i mean i cant tell
Ritvick Pandey: cause idk much about it
Ritvick Pandey: dekhna padega
Ritvick Pandey: aye thats not bad
Ritvick Pandey: not bad at all
Ritvick Pandey: ruk cs aur mech ka dekthe hai na
Ritvick Pandey: 20 for cs
Ritvick Pandey: again not bad
Ritvick Pandey: 151-200 for mech
Ritvick Pandey: fuckall
Ritvick Pandey: fuckit ill apply to CS edinburgh
Ritvick Pandey: is there a cs aptitude test
Ritvick Pandey: agar math hai then i can crack also
Himir Desai: And Edinburgh is like not at all difficult
Ritvick Pandey: aisa kya
Ritvick Pandey: not at all difficult matlab
Ritvick Pandey: admission
Ritvick Pandey: or college life
Himir Desai: Admission
Ritvick Pandey: aisa kya
Ritvick Pandey: ill apply for Edinburgh cs then

Ritvick Pandey: exactly like this
Ritvick Pandey: but the entire city is this picture
Ritvick Pandey: and its even prettier

Himir Desai: I even bribed my mom ki if i go to Edinburgh you will come every year here and do a vacation
Ritvick Pandey: FOUND IT
Ritvick Pandey: LOOK AT THE HOUSES MAN
Himir Desai: Retirement destination
Ritvick Pandey: and the little shops everywhere
Ritvick Pandey: when i was a kid only i decided that
Ritvick Pandey: i will come and live here as a rest home
Ritvick Pandey: whenever im sick of life
Ritvick Pandey: yess
Ritvick Pandey: Colmar, France
Ritvick Pandey: french ladies are also magnificient
Ritvick Pandey: its the most
Ritvick Pandey: perfect place
Ritvick Pandey: in the world
Himir Desai: And the houses are not too expensive its just 2Cr INR
Ritvick Pandey: haan its not a bigbig city na
Ritvick Pandey: its literally perfect
Ritvick Pandey: its not too out of town
Ritvick Pandey: not in middle of ity rush
Ritvick Pandey: just perfect
Ritvick Pandey: imagine living here with some good ass neighbours and 1-2 friends closeby
Ritvick Pandey: home next to some sundar cafe
Himir Desai: Not next to above a sundar cafe
Ritvick Pandey: BEO NO WAY MAN
Ritvick Pandey: were the
Ritvick Pandey: SAME PERSON MAN
Ritvick Pandey: i WRETOE
Ritvick Pandey: above a cafe
Ritvick Pandey: but then i said
Ritvick Pandey: no wait id want
Ritvick Pandey: a full house
Ritvick Pandey: so i said next to
Ritvick Pandey: bro
Himir Desai: 2 in 1
Ritvick Pandey: Edinburgh ka acceptance rate is 10% but
Ritvick Pandey: are u sure its utna aasan
Ritvick Pandey: im guessing cs will be hardest
Himir Desai: Because less people apply na
Himir Desai: I am sure because AGSD mai it is considered a backup for people with super high qualifications like us
Himir Desai: Courses in University of Edinburgh are the best
Ritvick Pandey: bro whatttt
Ritvick Pandey: no way
Himir Desai: See i said na it is like very easy
Ritvick Pandey: if 80 is miniumum
Himir Desai: And yet its a top university
Ritvick Pandey: 95 ( which well get with ease ) would be sureshot
Ritvick Pandey: NO FUCKING  YWA
Ritvick Pandey: BRO
Ritvick Pandey: CS AND PHYSICS
Ritvick Pandey: haan wtf
Ritvick Pandey: bro this is perfect
Ritvick Pandey: for a safety school
Ritvick Pandey: if oxford doesnt take us we can still go to one of the top institutes
Ritvick Pandey: and live
Ritvick Pandey: a
Ritvick Pandey: happy ass life
Himir Desai: Yes Edinburgh is the IIT Bombay of Scotland so respect will be 📈📈📈
Ritvick Pandey: i want to go here now
Ritvick Pandey: STOP it ur just making it
Ritvick Pandey: better and better
Ritvick Pandey: fuck bro
Ritvick Pandey: LOOK HOW SUNDAR DA
Ritvick Pandey: we can patao
Ritvick Pandey: two white girls
Ritvick Pandey: and go on
Ritvick Pandey: coffee dates
Ritvick Pandey: then go back
Ritvick Pandey: and learn
Ritvick Pandey: CS AND FUCKING PHYSICS
Ritvick Pandey: no way bro
Himir Desai: Ek big problem not big at all with the US standards but still
Ritvick Pandey: oxford ka is 50k
Ritvick Pandey: toh this is actually better more than a problem
Himir Desai: Ohh then this is fine i hust thought because scotland people ka its 1820
Ritvick Pandey: na na
Ritvick Pandey: oxford ka is 50k
Ritvick Pandey: plus oxford mai
Ritvick Pandey: living expense
Ritvick Pandey: is a lot
Ritvick Pandey: 30 pounds per day for hostel
Ritvick Pandey: with eating and all
Himir Desai: Edinburgh mai living expense is half of london
Ritvick Pandey: it comes up to 41 pounds per day
Ritvick Pandey: which over 4 years
Ritvick Pandey: is 50k pounds itself
Ritvick Pandey: so our fees for 4 years would be 2.5 crs
Ritvick Pandey: 2.6
Himir Desai: I just asked my dad he has saved 2Cr just for me in an FD
Ritvick Pandey: in Edinburgh just 1.2crs ( including whatever hostel is )
Ritvick Pandey: arrey same
Ritvick Pandey: my dad said he saved 1cr already
Ritvick Pandey: when my sister went to pvt college and he realised i also might go
Ritvick Pandey: and he said hell fund whatever till im 21
Ritvick Pandey: and after that im on my own
Himir Desai: Edinburgh mai software engineer ki average is 50K pounds
Himir Desai: Salary
Ritvick Pandey: we wont stay in Edinburgh ofcourse
Himir Desai: Ha wo to ik
Himir Desai: Masters karenge
Himir Desai: And all
Himir Desai: Ha but after bachelors i will take a minimum of 3 years ka work experience
Himir Desai: Like 4-5 years would be better
Himir Desai: Undergraduates mai philosophy bhi aa gaye
Ritvick Pandey: haa
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: but in general also
Ritvick Pandey: ive seen
Ritvick Pandey: uk colleges ka oplacements
Ritvick Pandey: is a lot lower
Ritvick Pandey: than usa
Ritvick Pandey: in oxford also
Ritvick Pandey: avg for engineers was 40k i believe
Himir Desai: Ha wo to hai but we trade thoda money with more security (or alteast I believe) and a quicker PR process
Ritvick Pandey: nvm 40k is for all undergrads
Ritvick Pandey: so for eng it must be higher
Ritvick Pandey: no
Ritvick Pandey: i find usa much more safe
Ritvick Pandey: lets say we get attacked
Ritvick Pandey: in usa atleast itll be direct headshot
Ritvick Pandey: in uk well be mauled with a knife
Ritvick Pandey: itll be like being eaten by a bear
Ritvick Pandey: a slow and painful death
Ritvick Pandey: atleast in US itll be quick
Himir Desai: Wo wala safe nai
Ritvick Pandey: then?
Ritvick Pandey: ohh
Himir Desai: Like US mai its all a lotery
Ritvick Pandey: application security
Ritvick Pandey: yesyes
Himir Desai: Lottery *
Ritvick Pandey: understood
Ritvick Pandey: yesyes
Ritvick Pandey: plus oxford sounds classy
Himir Desai: College lottery H1B literally lottery Green card lottery
Himir Desai: Everything is lottery
Ritvick Pandey: like when someone asks where u have studied from
Ritvick Pandey: saying oxford
Ritvick Pandey: would jsut feel nice
Ritvick Pandey: i mean so would MIT
Ritvick Pandey: but oxford feels classy ykwim
Himir Desai: Ha exactly ivies mai people just know harvand and maybe maybe princeton
Ritvick Pandey: haan exactly
Ritvick Pandey: in USA same feeling would come for some
Ritvick Pandey: like Carnegie melon
Ritvick Pandey: i wouldnt get the feeling
Ritvick Pandey: even tho its ranked 2
Ritvick Pandey: for mech
Ritvick Pandey: and UoFT
Ritvick Pandey: UofT*
Ritvick Pandey: all this doesnt give
Ritvick Pandey: same vibe
Ritvick Pandey: as Oxford
Ritvick Pandey: like bro
Ritvick Pandey: when was ur college founded
Ritvick Pandey: oh
Ritvick Pandey: 1000 bro
Ritvick Pandey: Harvard mai theres more arts politicis drama na
Himir Desai: Just pappu gandhi (I honestly forget the name) ne thoda naam bigad diya
Himir Desai: Ha
Ritvick Pandey: plus, we get to learn where Isaac newton was a professor
Himir Desai: If we get it that is
Ritvick Pandey: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Ritvick Pandey: thats the
Ritvick Pandey: good part
Ritvick Pandey: pappu went to cambridge
Ritvick Pandey: not oxford
Ritvick Pandey: its a plus
Himir Desai: Tell me his name i want to google
Himir Desai: Trinity oxford mai bhi tha
Ritvick Pandey: plus whoever actually goes to college onmerit
Ritvick Pandey: has been to oxford
Ritvick Pandey: ye nepotism wale
Ritvick Pandey: are all in camrbidge
Ritvick Pandey: pappu gandhi

Ritvick Pandey: an*
Himir Desai: Wa i checked just now
Ritvick Pandey: newton learnt at cambridge
Ritvick Pandey: taught at oxford
Ritvick Pandey: stepher hawking came was at both oxford and cambridge
Himir Desai: Ha but tab Cambridge bhi achha hoga na tab thodi ye politicians ne bigada hoga
Ritvick Pandey: ah i didnt know
Ritvick Pandey: haan haan ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: but the kings and all still wouldve gone there na
Ritvick Pandey: yaar
Ritvick Pandey: im just getting
Ritvick Pandey: more and more excited about college
Ritvick Pandey: and youre enabling this behavuour
Ritvick Pandey: ifeel like taking a flight to Edinburgh rn
Himir Desai: I didnt saw this before ye photo
Ritvick Pandey: no wau wtf
Ritvick Pandey: but compared to oxford and cambridge theyre still pretty unknown
Himir Desai: Ha because oxford is still oxford
Ritvick Pandey: wtf Sarojini naidu uh
Ritvick Pandey: haan thats what
Ritvick Pandey: bro wont I tbe crazy
Ritvick Pandey: going through books
Ritvick Pandey: the same books
Ritvick Pandey: fucking Einstein
Ritvick Pandey: Stephen hawking
Ritvick Pandey: EVEN NEWTON learnt from
Ritvick Pandey: like the same exact book
Ritvick Pandey: literal old ass book
Himir Desai: Ha lets go to oxford but we will have to wait for 8months and 4 days for our letter
Ritvick Pandey: 8 months sounds so far away
Ritvick Pandey: but
Ritvick Pandey: doesn’t sound that far away
Himir Desai: BHAI I WILL STAY HERE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IF I GO INSIDE
Ritvick Pandey: EXHALCRLY BHAI
Ritvick Pandey: FUCK DA I FANT WAIT
Himir Desai: Oxford ka decisions jaldi ate hai (Cambridge also) but other universities ke april ke aaspass ate
Ritvick Pandey: yess
Ritvick Pandey: unka deadline is also earlier na
Ritvick Pandey: khatarnak bro wtf
Ritvick Pandey: from india itself 2k ppl apply to oxford yearly
Ritvick Pandey: dumbfucks wont apply to oxford ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: im pretty sure everyone who applies matches the minimum requirements
Ritvick Pandey: that means just boards wont cut it
Ritvick Pandey: but they ask just boards
Ritvick Pandey: so in UK our essays become a lot more important than it wouldve been for US atleast
Ritvick Pandey: us had ECs and all to differentiate
Ritvick Pandey: in UK itll all be on our one single essay
Ritvick Pandey: that essay has to be too goood
Ritvick Pandey: ill start writing it from may 16th itself ( we can start our application then )
Ritvick Pandey: out of 1.6k Indian applicants (4th most applicants from a single country) 50 were accepted (2nd last no. of students accepted on the list of 11 countries, however some countries changed in the list)
Ritvick Pandey: anyway 3% acceptance rate for Indian students
Ritvick Pandey: I suppose some dumbfucks might've applied
Himir Desai: Not some a lot of dumbfucks
Ritvick Pandey: nahi na
Ritvick Pandey: because why would a lot have applied
Himir Desai: And essay nai MAT and PAT also matters
Ritvick Pandey: seeing the minimum requirements
Himir Desai: And interviews
Ritvick Pandey: OH YEA
Ritvick Pandey: I was forgetting mat and pat
Ritvick Pandey: thank you
Ritvick Pandey: thats what
Ritvick Pandey: i started wondering
Ritvick Pandey: PAT and MAT is accepted by icl also na
Ritvick Pandey: for Edinburgh we dont need exam also bro
Ritvick Pandey: how is it a top uni
Ritvick Pandey: we do nvm
Himir Desai: I dont know but unka boards requirement se mai dar gaya like it is possible but phir phy and chem mai also 95+ huh thoda mushkil
Ritvick Pandey: phy toh hojayega
Ritvick Pandey: chem mai 95+ is v v v vmushkil
Ritvick Pandey: 95 lana
Ritvick Pandey: ARREY RUKO
Ritvick Pandey: dekhoooooooooo
Himir Desai: Chem mai now its just organic mostly because block has been removed
Ritvick Pandey: 95 in boards
Ritvick Pandey: would be 75/80
Ritvick Pandey: in our final test
Himir Desai: 65/70
Ritvick Pandey: + 20 of practicals
Himir Desai: 30 hote hai
Ritvick Pandey: accha then 30 practicals
Ritvick Pandey: but stilll
Ritvick Pandey: we can lose 5 marks
Ritvick Pandey: thank fuck
Ritvick Pandey: it reduces
Ritvick Pandey: 1.5 marks ka pressure
Ritvick Pandey: warna we wouldve needed 66.5
Ritvick Pandey: see we can lose 5 marks na
Ritvick Pandey: thats doable
Ritvick Pandey: not for me in chem
Himir Desai: Ha doable
Ritvick Pandey: but hopefuflly it will be]
Ritvick Pandey: or what i can do is get 95 in Phy math English AI
Ritvick Pandey: thisll work for imperial but oxford needs for pcm i guess
Himir Desai: And i checked Edinburgh and oxford dono mai we will like use only £2K per month compared to london unis where we would use £3-4K
Himir Desai: And in those 2K i have counted 800 for fun
Ritvick Pandey: yaar but
Ritvick Pandey: i wont be satisfied in edinburgh
Ritvick Pandey: knowing i coudve done better
Ritvick Pandey: or gone to an IIT
Ritvick Pandey: ill get more respect
Ritvick Pandey: from IIT
Ritvick Pandey: than edinburgh
Ritvick Pandey: fs
Ritvick Pandey: dont u think so too
Himir Desai: I just want maja thats all
Ritvick Pandey: oxford would be pure class bro
Ritvick Pandey: its surprising how ur like this
Ritvick Pandey: i want that feel
Ritvick Pandey: jab koi pucche kidhar se padhe ho
Himir Desai: Ha but IIT mai i will get external respect but andar se to i would be rotting
Ritvick Pandey: see
Ritvick Pandey: calling external respect er and andar se ar
Ritvick Pandey: my most favourable to least favourable is
Ritvick Pandey: ar being andar se good
Ritvick Pandey: ar + er , no ar + er , ar + no er
Ritvick Pandey: basically oxford, iit, edinburgh
Himir Desai: Ha but mere liye to CS so i will need AIR under 290 for top 6 iits
Ritvick Pandey: thats another issue
Ritvick Pandey: to get wanted branch
Ritvick Pandey: in india id want to do cs
Ritvick Pandey: not mech
Ritvick Pandey: because mech in india is saddening
Ritvick Pandey: unless its iit ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: but still
Ritvick Pandey: mech at iitb is pretty low rank i guess
Ritvick Pandey: and i dont want to do jee at all
Himir Desai: Mech is best kn germany i guess but waha language barrier
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: mere chachu
Ritvick Pandey: oh ididnt tell na
Ritvick Pandey: my chachu (older one) likes to travel a lot
Ritvick Pandey: hes been to a total of 110+ countries
Ritvick Pandey: hes always travelling
Himir Desai: The thing is i know that if i will do JEE ka prep 24/7 to i will definitely get desired branch and college but still infra is bad
Ritvick Pandey: he made money after college he joined Infosys and got a fuckton of stock
Ritvick Pandey: then ifosys popped off
Ritvick Pandey: anyway so hes like the crazy type ykwim
Ritvick Pandey: he randomly
Ritvick Pandey: at this age
Ritvick Pandey: felt like doing masters
Ritvick Pandey: so hes doing m eng from germany
Ritvick Pandey: today i met him
Ritvick Pandey: hes come to blr
Ritvick Pandey: he told me
Ritvick Pandey: Germany is v good for mech
Ritvick Pandey: and theres one college next to his that teaches in eng
Ritvick Pandey: hes going to karlsruhe
Ritvick Pandey: he told he was considering oxford for masters but he stelled in germany
Himir Desai: Jagah ka naam hai?
Ritvick Pandey: anyway i might go to germany
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: haan thats what i said na
Ritvick Pandey: i dont want to do jee at all
Ritvick Pandey: but if i do
Ritvick Pandey: iit is a sure shot
Ritvick Pandey: but i dont want to theres no motivation to go a place that looks like that
Himir Desai: I only remember one experience of mine in germany i had to play dumsheras to get a pani ki bottle for like 10 minutes
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO
Ritvick Pandey: i know german
Ritvick Pandey: so i could go to
Ritvick Pandey: shops and all
Ritvick Pandey: only not that efficient to learn engineering in german
Himir Desai: I have French ka A1 but that is bare minimum i will still need Google translate
Ritvick Pandey: arrey same
Ritvick Pandey: when i was a kid
Ritvick Pandey: someone told me
Ritvick Pandey: knowing a lot of languages is a sign of intelligence
Ritvick Pandey: so i took up French, german and kannada
Ritvick Pandey: then i thought its a waste of time
Ritvick Pandey: so i left it
Himir Desai: I gave DELF Junior A1 last year and i got 85.5/100
Ritvick Pandey: but i ended up learning a basic level of all
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: i want to learn sanskrit
Ritvick Pandey: appr its the hardest language to learn
Himir Desai: I had Sanskrit in school for 4 years
Himir Desai: No 5
Himir Desai: In boards i got 99 in Sanskrit if I remember correctly
Ritvick Pandey: no way thats so cool bro wtf
Himir Desai: And i have forgotten already i cannot produce my own Sanskrit writing write now but i can understand
Ritvick Pandey: bro
Ritvick Pandey: this is one big advantage
Ritvick Pandey: of abroad unis

Ritvick Pandey: my elder chachu was a big nerd ok he got 100
Ritvick Pandey: % scholarship and all
Ritvick Pandey: in undergrad

Ritvick Pandey: so i’m guessing earth ka tilt
Ritvick Pandey: it can’t be anything else
Ritvick Pandey: but it’s not impressive enough to be a board ka project
Himir Desai: Achha samaj gaya konsa wala tilf

Himir Desai: I thought initially ki having some real experience will elevate my chances of getting an internship in college but this internship is gadha majdoori so i will just ignore it most probably
Ritvick Pandey: nahi u weren’t wrong technically
Ritvick Pandey: with this internship as experience
Ritvick Pandey: you can apply to another internship during school only ( this year )
Ritvick Pandey: like some startup mai some programming karne wala intern
Ritvick Pandey: this internship will help u get that
Ritvick Pandey: and that internship will help in college
Himir Desai: Ha but mere pass samay ki bohot pabandi hai
Ritvick Pandey: https://youtube.com/shorts/mGJqp3D5COw?feature=share

Ritvick Pandey: my passport expired this month
Ritvick Pandey: and my friend told they didn’t allow him with aadhar even tho on the website. it says aadhar is fine
Himir Desai: Depends on the center actually like last year in Mumbai they strictly required a valid non expired passport and this year in Ahmedabad they dont even check for IDs
Himir Desai: I still take both passport and aadhar card
Ritvick Pandey: kaunsa waala aadhar
Ritvick Pandey: in aadhar also its written original letter form, or PVC version with hologram
Ritvick Pandey: I got aadhar again this year as u have to update biometrics
Ritvick Pandey: and they delivered to my home
Ritvick Pandey: but they didnt deliver a letter
Ritvick Pandey: letter version nahi hai
Himir Desai: on collegeboard ki website it says pvc wala is only allowed with hologram
Ritvick Pandey: they j gave a normal card
Ritvick Pandey: anyway
Himir Desai: tere card mai is there that hologram?
Himir Desai: Bhai Ahmedabad center mai to meri jagah if my brother goes and gives then also noone would know
Himir Desai: SAT ke liye bhi same hi center tha but they checked the passport then abhi to kuchh bhi nahi come and give and go
Ritvick Pandey: i got this only in delivery
Himir Desai: is this a general mail or is this a reply to your question
Ritvick Pandey: i have this but with old biometrics, ill show this first as its letter if they say no then ill show the card
Ritvick Pandey: general mail
Himir Desai: and your center is a school or is it some testing facility
Ritvick Pandey: greenwood high school

Ritvick Pandey: airports and all
Ritvick Pandey: stopped accepting old wala
Ritvick Pandey: bc kid picture
Ritvick Pandey: idk lets see
Ritvick Pandey: tune padha kya mechanics
Ritvick Pandey: mai ek baar formula sheet padh lunga
Himir Desai: ha then school wale people understand "sometimes" testing facility wale do not know the importance of the exam and so do not allow
Ritvick Pandey: actually nevermind they provide sheet
Himir Desai: mechanics mai to kuchh nahi hai maine nahi padha and 50/90 is a 5/5 and if its an easy one then 60/90 both I can get if I give it even in deep sleep
Ritvick Pandey: haan i saw 54% is a 5

Ritvick Pandey: its a joke bro
Himir Desai: i like pulleys ache hote hai
Himir Desai: unless wo friction wale ho and string mai current flow kar raha ho and everything is in a non constant magnetic field and that to in a non inertial frame
Himir Desai: tab thoda mushkil hota hai
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: i love pulley qs
Ritvick Pandey: i love nlm qs

Himir Desai: They are walking distance away
Ritvick Pandey: ik
Ritvick Pandey: my parents werr there only na
Ritvick Pandey: so they keep telling
Ritvick Pandey: bro MIT is a goal for so many colleges it’s absurd
Himir Desai: I would prefer the east coast because California super expensive but UCs are dirt cheap their tuition
Ritvick Pandey: BITS Goa ke dome ka inspiration
Ritvick Pandey: and Imperial was built for there to be a MIT in the UK
Ritvick Pandey: UCs ka is same as others na
Himir Desai: But I still am resistant towards MIT kyuki usme bohot stress and load

Himir Desai: Tuition UCs ka is 1/3rd of iview
Himir Desai: Nahi MIT is also super expensive
Ritvick Pandey: nahi
Ritvick Pandey: i put my dads salary
Ritvick Pandey: in collegeboard fees calculator
Ritvick Pandey: and no college reduces
Ritvick Pandey: some fucking added fees
Ritvick Pandey: reduced*

Ritvick Pandey: 1 admit per year
Ritvick Pandey: you’ll need 100%
Himir Desai: 2020-21 ka hai but
Ritvick Pandey: esp considering u want CS
Ritvick Pandey: but everyone gets aid
Ritvick Pandey: even if u put salary as
Ritvick Pandey: 500k per year
Ritvick Pandey: u still get aid

Himir Desai: To you will apply to MIT and apply for aid
Ritvick Pandey: they decreased atleast by 30k usd
Ritvick Pandey: nahi
Ritvick Pandey: they give u aid
Ritvick Pandey: i won’t apply
Ritvick Pandey: plus mit is need blind

Himir Desai: Mere nae consultant ko hai wo sab kuchh mere liye karenge like essay mai likhunga but application fill and documents collect and submit and mails checking and all sab wo hi karenge
Ritvick Pandey: baaki sabkuch toh is
Ritvick Pandey: mindless task

Himir Desai: Ha ha happens a lot
Himir Desai: I will still keep that my first prio
Ritvick Pandey: i justg saw
Ritvick Pandey: and imperial ka application deadline is only 31st march itself
Ritvick Pandey: the actual deadline is 31st jan, but they've said theyll try and treat 31st march waaale equally
Ritvick Pandey: nahi nvm
Ritvick Pandey: i read wrong
Ritvick Pandey: 31st march ko
Ritvick Pandey: they give results
Ritvick Pandey: jan 31st is deadline
Ritvick Pandey: whenll u start ur essays?
Ritvick Pandey: UCAS ka bhi portal opens on may16th

Ritvick Pandey: madarchod 99.7 conditional offer
Ritvick Pandey: exam date par phatt jayegi meri
Ritvick Pandey: already i get exam stress
Himir Desai: They may accept lower if there are seats left
Ritvick Pandey: i saw
Ritvick Pandey: somewhere it was written
Ritvick Pandey: oxford never, basically never takes under conditional offer
Ritvick Pandey: like maybe once in their lifetime they've taken
Ritvick Pandey: so v unlikely
Ritvick Pandey: that chart par
Ritvick Pandey: chart of PAT scores
Ritvick Pandey: remember how after a certain score it was given offer not even given interview
Ritvick Pandey: direct offer
Ritvick Pandey: mostly ill just aim to get 100 in PAT
Ritvick Pandey: then they cant rlly tell me to fuck off
Ritvick Pandey: plus 100 in pat would be muchmuch easier than 99 in boards
Ritvick Pandey: 100 as in v good
Himir Desai: Swayam got 72 in MAT and still got Oxford ma interview
Ritvick Pandey: haan but
Ritvick Pandey: scores above some number i cant remember
Ritvick Pandey: it was written direct offer
Ritvick Pandey: no interview also
Ritvick Pandey: 72 is considered v v good
Ritvick Pandey: in PAT (which is easier than MAT) 60+ is considered excellent
Himir Desai: I want that because i suck at interviews
Ritvick Pandey: according to ppl on quora
Himir Desai: Not for oxford
Ritvick Pandey: when i said this
Ritvick Pandey: u replied saying how ur fine with interviews
Ritvick Pandey: and it wnt bother u at all
Himir Desai: Nahi nahi nahi
Ritvick Pandey: im fucking scared for interview
Himir Desai: Not possible

Ritvick Pandey: then open tv and watch
Ritvick Pandey: announcement
Ritvick Pandey: arrey its a bunch of
Ritvick Pandey: gora log
Ritvick Pandey: discussing their children ka PAT score
Ritvick Pandey: im not stating anything said by Oxford
Himir Desai: I said nahi nahi nahi for this
Ritvick Pandey: 90+ is 100% admission
Ritvick Pandey: in MAT ppl in 91-95 also dont have 100% admission
Himir Desai: Ha because MAT wale courses are more sought
Ritvick Pandey: Himir
Ritvick Pandey: Do you think
Ritvick Pandey: MAT is easier than PAT
Ritvick Pandey: and were just rlly good at physics
Himir Desai: Those people who give PAT go into pure science na and there are less people like that but same nimber of seats almost
Ritvick Pandey: then these stats should be opposite na
Ritvick Pandey: accha it could be because your competition is only so gaand faad
Ritvick Pandey: fucking ppl from all across the world applying for cs
Himir Desai: Wahi to wahi to
Himir Desai: They should have
Himir Desai: More seats for CS

Ritvick Pandey: and the exam is by cambridge
Himir Desai: He is in SRG (special rankers group) here to he has a achha level ka aptitude
Ritvick Pandey: arrey that doesn’t matter
Ritvick Pandey: my friend is in SSRG
Ritvick Pandey: 2-3 S’ idk

Ritvick Pandey: i had also got into SRG only
Himir Desai: Nahi here SRG mai ane ke liye you need teachers ka attention
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Himir Desai: Baki whatever exam it may be prepared ho to ho hi jaega
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: also i asked that oxford admission recruiter
Ritvick Pandey: so
Ritvick Pandey: our tests will be before our interviews
Ritvick Pandey: so our test score will be considered before we get accepted/rejected for interview
Himir Desai: Ha kyuki you will get interviews based on test result
Ritvick Pandey: so we both have definite interview chance atleast
Ritvick Pandey: u knew that uh
Ritvick Pandey: when i had asked earlier even u said u weren’t sure
Ritvick Pandey: so i asked that person
Himir Desai: If swayam got oxford ka interview even after giving MAT in appendix pain (he had his operation next day) we will defined get the interview
Himir Desai: Ha i am not sure but now you made me sure
Ritvick Pandey: can u ask this imperial wala aadmi what all classes ka scores he had to submit
Himir Desai: Ha sure
Ritvick Pandey: the oxford wala person said they might ask for junior years too ( in their UK system they ask for class 11 which is their GCSE which is 2 years before their final year 13th )
Ritvick Pandey: so it’ll be our 10th
Ritvick Pandey: if they ask 10th and 12th we’re chilling
Ritvick Pandey: ur chilling toh 11th also
Ritvick Pandey: i hope they don’t ask 11th i’ll shoot myself ong
Himir Desai: I have asked him
Ritvick Pandey: haan that’s what
Ritvick Pandey: thanks
Ritvick Pandey: chalo i’ll go brush and all
Ritvick Pandey: it’s so hard to wake up early
Himir Desai: Yes it is super hard
Ritvick Pandey: hello
Ritvick Pandey: fuck
Ritvick Pandey: ru close with him cause then i have more qs
Ritvick Pandey: did imperial ask 9-11th separately or did he have to submit 9-11th on UCAS? Was it the same for Oxford?
Ritvick Pandey: also haan the oxford wala told
Ritvick Pandey: that they have a seperate place
Ritvick Pandey: to write why u scored less
Ritvick Pandey: if there’s a reason
Ritvick Pandey: i forgot the word he used
Himir Desai: I will reply after class
Himir Desai: Enough close hai
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: check kar na
Himir Desai: Kya
Ritvick Pandey: cause imperial wale told its not required
Ritvick Pandey: and oxford wale said they might depending on country
Ritvick Pandey: yahi
Himir Desai: To we also need to send the results separately to each college ya UCAS par hi ye na?
Ritvick Pandey: nahi I mean
Ritvick Pandey: did he upload 9-11 on UCAS
Ritvick Pandey: or did imperial ask him separately after seeing his UCAS
Ritvick Pandey: cause if we need to submit on UCAS that means all UK colleges require 11th
Ritvick Pandey: but if he submitted separately means only imperial asked
Himir Desai: Achha puchh liya i will tell you as soon as he replies
Ritvick Pandey: thanks
Ritvick Pandey: accha i’m off to sleep so i can wake up early
Ritvick Pandey: yaar if UCAS also needs 11th then i’ll need to do fucking IIT bro fuck my life
Himir Desai: UCAS pe hi dalne hai
Ritvick Pandey: aisa kya
Ritvick Pandey: fuckkk
Himir Desai: Tere report card pe absent likha hai ya 0? Ya tune injured stiti mai exam de di thi
Ritvick Pandey: na not absent
Ritvick Pandey: they forced me to write
Ritvick Pandey: there’s no retest
Himir Desai: Your school is kitna faltu atleast they should give a retest for their mistakes not exactly theirs but they supported it
Ritvick Pandey: i know
Ritvick Pandey: it’s fucking irritating
Ritvick Pandey: i asked for a retest but they said itd be unfair practices
Himir Desai: One student in Vadodara got 300/300 in jee mains par uska result got currupted 3-4 hours after result came to subah 300/300 sham ko dekha tab 0/300 with all questions unattended par usne High Court mai case kara abhi bhi chal raha ekdum recent baat hai ye 2-3 weeks hue. To use JEE Advance 0/300 pe dene ki permission mil gai
Himir Desai: Wo actually AIR 1 lane wala bachha hai
Himir Desai: To ab maine sikh le li hai kuchh bhi ho hame fight deni hi chahiye
Ritvick Pandey: wtf no fucking way
Ritvick Pandey: bro he could na
Ritvick Pandey: my family id consider is pretty influential
Ritvick Pandey: but dps is owned by dons
Ritvick Pandey: like literal mafias
Himir Desai: His case was even worse then yours use to na india na bahar kahi nahi milta
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t be bothered
Ritvick Pandey: plus the other guy involved
Ritvick Pandey: got terminated from school
Ritvick Pandey: they didn’t remove me because i only win everything for my school
Himir Desai: Dusre school mai admission mila ki fake charges pe terminate kara?
Ritvick Pandey: idk bro he had to leave but
Ritvick Pandey: his parents made a request
Ritvick Pandey: so he got offer to stay in NIOS
Ritvick Pandey: or go to another dps
Ritvick Pandey: warna if he got terminated hed be blacklisted from all schools
Himir Desai: You are kitna helpless i feel bad now
Ritvick Pandey: yaar i didn’t expect the UCAS thing
Ritvick Pandey: i feel fucked up now
Himir Desai: You will have to request them to give achha predicted scores
Ritvick Pandey: that i will get
Ritvick Pandey: i told na
Himir Desai: 9th 10th mai achha hai
Ritvick Pandey: math HOD loves me
Ritvick Pandey: she sorta predicted
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: 10th top
Ritvick Pandey: 9th mai not so good
Ritvick Pandey: 97% i guess
Ritvick Pandey: 96-97
Himir Desai: Me too 9th mai 92.6 10th mai 97.2 11th mai 95 12th mai 96-97 predicted
Himir Desai: They will ignore 11th ke scores for you if you say them you were sick
Himir Desai: Kyuki 11th mai only ek exam mai kam honge na
Ritvick Pandey: na
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll need to give sick ka medical report na
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll figure something out
Himir Desai: Get it na
Ritvick Pandey: nakli my parents won’t allow
Ritvick Pandey: my uncle can sort but my mom refuses
Ritvick Pandey: she says it’s unethical
Himir Desai: Ha and what they did is very ethical
Ritvick Pandey: my mom doesn’t care brk
Ritvick Pandey: she says two wrongs don’t make a right
Ritvick Pandey: etc etc
Ritvick Pandey: plus she wants me to go to IIT anyway
Ritvick Pandey: so she just says why ur stressing for that so much IIT won’t ask for ur 11th scores
Himir Desai: Ye bhi sahi hai
Himir Desai: But not my way of thinking
Himir Desai: But ab thinking of the past wont help
Ritvick Pandey: goodmorning
Ritvick Pandey: i had slept
Ritvick Pandey: sahi mai ye kitna vella aadmi hai
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: but thats what my mom keeps saying
Ritvick Pandey: bhai himir i got up cause this girl called and it was about UCAS only she said it’s not mandatory to put in class 11
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll call up someone else who got into uk uni tmrw and check
Ritvick Pandey: it’s fine sad mat ho
Ritvick Pandey: i’m pretty sure they took everyone who had research experience
Himir Desai: I am not sad i am more of like relieved got one hanging sword off my head
Himir Desai: Aaj mera poora mood was achha i even wrote a quote in like 1-2 minutes wait let me write it again
Himir Desai: The past is gone; future yet to come.
    What you live is the(a) present: What you live is the(a) present
Himir Desai: Very punctuation heavy quote but thats what i can do in 1 minute
Ritvick Pandey: bhai this is
Ritvick Pandey: literally the most famous quote of the world
Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭😭😭
Himir Desai: Except i edited it
Ritvick Pandey: ma yahi to bolti hai
Himir Desai: Hame EAT mai kya sikhaya tha pata hai
Ritvick Pandey: a present na
Ritvick Pandey: i’ve read this somewhere bol raha hoon
Ritvick Pandey: EAT? kya sikhate hain
Himir Desai: Pura lecture was on the topic ki art is not about creating something its reorganising what already exits
Himir Desai: Exists*
Himir Desai: To a present wala quote suna hai and past future wala to i merged them
Himir Desai: Naya art ban gaya
Himir Desai: Expressive Art Therapy
Himir Desai: BITS mai
Himir Desai: To prove their point they asked us to draw an animal jo exist hi nahi karta real mai and then every single one of us drew some animal which borrows one part from some animal which exists and then another part from some other like dog turtle something like that
Ritvick Pandey: hi
Ritvick Pandey: sorry i had to leave mom called asking why i’m awake
Ritvick Pandey: this wasn’t in EAT
Ritvick Pandey: i was there na
Ritvick Pandey: it might have been in EAT also
Ritvick Pandey: but this they said in that
Ritvick Pandey: paper tower making competition also
Himir Desai: Nahi wait
Himir Desai: That was not in eat
Himir Desai: It was in dusra vlass
Himir Desai: Class*
Himir Desai: Jisme maam hated you and sid
Ritvick Pandey: exwcty
Ritvick Pandey: this only
Himir Desai: Array ha nahi
Ritvick Pandey: newspaper tower
Himir Desai: EAT was not that
Himir Desai: Yahi class mai they taught this
Himir Desai: EAT mai to we jumped in circular rings
Ritvick Pandey: also, so i got up because this girl kept calling me about UCAS and she talked to her friend who got into UK unis from our school and apparently she didn’t have to submit class 9-11
Himir Desai: Achha sorry EAT nahi they taught this in dusra Art wala class
Ritvick Pandey: bhai🤣🤣🤣
Ritvick Pandey: i miss BITS yaar
Ritvick Pandey: it was too fun
Himir Desai: Ha i was typing iska then i cut it so now i will paste and send after completing the msg
Ritvick Pandey: i’m still shocked as to how this aryan chutiya got in
Ritvick Pandey: he failed 12th boards!
Ritvick Pandey: he got grace marks he’s saying
Ritvick Pandey: and how stupid can someone be to fail 10th! (adarsh)
Ritvick Pandey: okk
Himir Desai: See anyone who would have got into UK would have submitted their 11th grades so they wont know much instead mail the college from some other fake gmail or something or ask counsellors or someone who actually knows
Ritvick Pandey: i asked in the ask us about college thing on imperial ka website
Ritvick Pandey: and the ICSE student said na
Ritvick Pandey: only 12th
Himir Desai: Nahi he got 79.2% he was lying in the group msg
Ritvick Pandey: i found imperial ka contact option also and was planning to mail them tomorrow
Ritvick Pandey: i was feeling too fucked up so i went to sleep
Ritvick Pandey: same with oxford
Ritvick Pandey: but if one guy who literally got into imperial is saying then i’m screwed
Ritvick Pandey: why would he lie wtf
Himir Desai: I saw his result na to ik
Ritvick Pandey: he sent to u??
Himir Desai: Why
Himir Desai: I asked him to send it kyuki before his 10th boards he was asking me about maths so i asked him to send
Ritvick Pandey: see as far as i think so far-
CAS you can put only 12th or 9-12th but admission criteria is 12th marks: CAS you can put only 12th or 9-12th but admission criteria is 12th marks
Ritvick Pandey: haan he was asking me about calculus before his math 12th board
Ritvick Pandey: why matlab
Ritvick Pandey: a guy who got accepted will know the requirements na
Himir Desai: Wo aryan tha
Ritvick Pandey: i’m also speaking of aryan
Ritvick Pandey: who are you speaking about
Ritvick Pandey: adarsh?
Ritvick Pandey: i’m saying aryan got 70%
Himir Desai: Achha I matlab i though he is screwed
Himir Desai: Adarsh
Himir Desai: Replying to this
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: why would he fail about lying
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t understand that person at all
Ritvick Pandey: poor broke family
Ritvick Pandey: but travels daily
Ritvick Pandey: and has a Macbook
Himir Desai: Don’t understand him na we are talking important stuff imperial and oxford and all
Ritvick Pandey: yeah exactly
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t believe such an important part of my future may be ruined due to such a thing
Ritvick Pandey: how frustrating
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll speak to someone from oxford/imperial tmrw
Ritvick Pandey: let’s see
Ritvick Pandey: the only good thing is
Ritvick Pandey: we know for sure now that the interview acceptance is based on the test score
Ritvick Pandey: and i’m intellectually capable enough to ace the PAT
Himir Desai: And i was hesitant to go to UK till now because waha they give very less options after our degree gets over but now i realised UT DOESNT MATTER mai wese bhi masters karne wala hu to why am I worried about UK mai expensive settle thodi hona hai
Ritvick Pandey: hence i’m still confident
Himir Desai: And Imperial to achha US college gor masters would be easier than BITS se achha US college
Ritvick Pandey: because end of the day the thing they get to compare me with other students will be PAT score
Himir Desai: Ha that to even i am sure after seeing PAT ka paper
Ritvick Pandey: yesss
Ritvick Pandey: i was seeing
Ritvick Pandey: not seeing
Ritvick Pandey: thinking
Ritvick Pandey: if we go to UK
Ritvick Pandey: there’s a lot of colleges
Ritvick Pandey: first of all
Ritvick Pandey: credentials-
achelors in Engineering, masters in engineering & MBA: achelors in Engineering, masters in engineering & MBA
Ritvick Pandey: all from top colleges
Ritvick Pandey: we’ll have 2 masters
Ritvick Pandey: in same amount of time
Ritvick Pandey: and this too
Ritvick Pandey: from oxford our journey to harvard business school will be easier than from BITS
Ritvick Pandey: ya
Himir Desai: Exactly par agar I directly get into top US college tab to koi question hi nahi hai
Ritvick Pandey: so i’ll just get a 100 on PAT
Ritvick Pandey: and explain my 11th scores
Ritvick Pandey: yeah that’s what
Himir Desai: MIT,Stanford,Yale,Princeton,Cornell,Caltech,Berkeley>Oxford,Imperial>UCs,GTech,UofT,Waterloo,UBC
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: did not expect that
Ritvick Pandey: MIT,Stanford,Caltech>Oxford,Imperial>Princeton, Berkeley, UCs,GTech,UofT,Waterloo,UBC
Ritvick Pandey: mine
Himir Desai: See after getting rejected from QSYS i am not sad but i have gotten less confident about getting into top US colleges
Ritvick Pandey: no
Ritvick Pandey: being honest
Ritvick Pandey: i believe you have a very good shot at Berkeley
Ritvick Pandey: you show good academic scores throughout, you have good ECs and i love your writing ( i don’t like other ppl ka writing)
Ritvick Pandey: however for MIT there is no good profile
Ritvick Pandey: as in theres no guarantee
Ritvick Pandey: that u get in
Ritvick Pandey: no matter what u do
Ritvick Pandey: i saw this bhaiya ka post on linkedin
Ritvick Pandey: he had fucking 4-5 OLYMPIAD MEDALS BRO
Ritvick Pandey: Chem
Ritvick Pandey: Math
Ritvick Pandey: and Astronomy
Ritvick Pandey: yet he got rejected from MIT
Himir Desai: Berkeley is a good uni but i am still not confident now it will take some days to get that confidence back
Ritvick Pandey: but he went to IIT bombay CSE
Ritvick Pandey: this year he applied for transfer to MIT and got accepted
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t rmeneber
Ritvick Pandey: but it was a lot of olympiad achievement
Himir Desai: MIT mujhe dil se nahi jana agar they accept me then i will definitely go but the decision would be from mind not heart
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: for me MIT has always been from heart
Ritvick Pandey: my uncle and dad studied something there
Ritvick Pandey: and ever since i’m a kid
Ritvick Pandey: i hear about how great it is
Ritvick Pandey: and it’s excellence
Ritvick Pandey: and it just made me feel how it’s the best of the best
Ritvick Pandey: which is what i wanna be ( which is why MIT APPEALS to me so much )
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: see that’s another UK college plus
Ritvick Pandey: u know the entire process
Ritvick Pandey: so you know if ur getting in or not
Himir Desai: Achha Wo mahit ghadhiwala
Ritvick Pandey: don’t know bro i accidentally refreshed and couldn’t connect with him
Ritvick Pandey: haan yahi
Ritvick Pandey: how good is this MFs profile
Ritvick Pandey: and he still got rejected
Himir Desai: UK ka i dont have problem as of now maybe usme bhi confidence chala jae after Atlas who knows
Ritvick Pandey: bhai trust me
Himir Desai: I said na US is a lottery
Ritvick Pandey: i usually only trust my intellect ability cause of how much i love myself
Ritvick Pandey: but you’re for sure a top applicant
Ritvick Pandey: but now no matter how good ur profile is
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: a college like MIT is lottery
Himir Desai: I just want things to get over matlab its not the decision which makes me feel sad or depressed or anything ots the wait
Himir Desai: Abhi i got QSYS ka decision to i will move on as simple as that but the past few days i dont know if it was that or something else i want happy
Himir Desai: Abhi i have decided to play basketball every week will a friend of mine others will come if they will but even if noone comes we both will go
Himir Desai: Kyuki i have heard ki sports se mental health sudharti
Ritvick Pandey: i understand bro
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: good u started
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll make u fitter also
Ritvick Pandey: i heard the same
Ritvick Pandey: which is why i added gym to schedule even tho i was so busy already
Ritvick Pandey: see
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t want to be that guy
Ritvick Pandey: but literally everyone or anywhere you go
Ritvick Pandey: in whatever country
Ritvick Pandey: or whatever religion
Ritvick Pandey: one line that’s common i’ve seen is
Ritvick Pandey: if you want something bad enough / if you work hard enough for something no matter what happens you get it somehow
Ritvick Pandey: i know it sounds like BS cause i always thought it did
Ritvick Pandey: but if u think about it there’s nothing u can do other than working as hard as possible
Ritvick Pandey: so might as well
Ritvick Pandey: ho jaye toh great
Himir Desai: My reasoning for anything that happens whenever is that god has planned things for you already this is a bump in the grand plan
Ritvick Pandey: even if not it’s fine kidhar aur hojayega
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: my mum says that
Ritvick Pandey: see himir
Ritvick Pandey: both you and i na
Ritvick Pandey: regardless of where we go
Ritvick Pandey: we’ll be fucking loaded for sure
Ritvick Pandey: fucking loaded as in v rich
Ritvick Pandey: plus
Ritvick Pandey: whatever worst case happens
Ritvick Pandey: it’s not like we’ll go to DU
Ritvick Pandey: so we’ll still have a little edge over others
Ritvick Pandey: basically koi na koi good college mai hojayega
Ritvick Pandey: don’t stress
Himir Desai: College ka stress nahi hai mujhe its like ki ham kaam kar rahe hai but point kya sabka and wahi existential wali chiz but ab its even worse kyuki now its like grind for 1 more year and see if you won the lottery or not
Ritvick Pandey: oh that
Ritvick Pandey: uska to kuch nahi kar sakte hai
Ritvick Pandey: i had texted you due to the same reason na
Ritvick Pandey: see
Ritvick Pandey: even if it seems pointless rn
Ritvick Pandey: do it anyway
Ritvick Pandey: because after some point
Ritvick Pandey: when ur feeling better and it doesn’t seem pointless
Ritvick Pandey: ull be in a fuckall situation because u didn’t do it rn
Ritvick Pandey: do anything rn*
Himir Desai: What is feel better if i know that i will feel worse in a few days
Ritvick Pandey: na trust me it’ll get better eventually
Ritvick Pandey: for ex- in 11th i was feeling this and then the whole incident happened and i fucked that test
Ritvick Pandey: i was feeling like that so i didn’t bother doing anything
Ritvick Pandey: saying how does anything matter anyway
Ritvick Pandey: but if i were there rn ( as in me in my current mental health not that times) i’d do a lot more
Ritvick Pandey: i’d fight with the teachers
Ritvick Pandey: change schools and get retest
Ritvick Pandey: etc etc
Ritvick Pandey: but i didn’t do anything
Ritvick Pandey: and now the current me is getting fucked for it
Ritvick Pandey: so even if it feels useless do it anyway
Ritvick Pandey: so your future himir doesn’t get fucked
Ritvick Pandey: and even if there isn’t a future himir who feels better
Ritvick Pandey: then also u don’t lose anything working hard cause if nothing matters whatever u do won’t matter
Ritvick Pandey: so might as well work hard
Himir Desai: OK BHAI NOW MY MOTTO IS GO PLAY BASKETBALL TOMORROW AND THEN DO SUPER HARD WORK TILL I GET INTO ANY COLLEGE KOI SI BHI AND LIVE THERE HAPPILY
Ritvick Pandey: YES
Ritvick Pandey: DONT MAKE UR MOTTO PLAY BAZKETBALL BUT I LIKE THE JOSH
Ritvick Pandey: chal enjoy karna kal i’ll go sleep
Himir Desai: Ala that is because abhi ke jivan mai that is the only source of happiness
Ritvick Pandey: accha ok karlo
Ritvick Pandey: i also used to play basketball
Ritvick Pandey: we’ll play once
Ritvick Pandey: bhai see
Ritvick Pandey: worst case
Ritvick Pandey: if us rejects us
Ritvick Pandey: uk rejects us
Ritvick Pandey: ekdum worst case
Ritvick Pandey: worst of the worst case
Ritvick Pandey: we’ll both go off to IIT bombay bro
Ritvick Pandey: that is a lot of logo ka dream
Ritvick Pandey: we’ll have brilliant connections
Ritvick Pandey: and you can score good in 1at year and shift to CS in 2nd year
Ritvick Pandey: don’t stress ab college kidhar hojayega
Ritvick Pandey: chal goodnight
Himir Desai: Bhai i wont go there kyuki waha milega to i will have to rethink going to US kyuki i would not take anything less that CS and CS IITB is AIR<65 to mai ek saal IIT jakar MIT mai transfer ma le lu
Himir Desai: Nai that risk i would never take
Ritvick Pandey: arrey if u don’t get that
Ritvick Pandey: then u could take transfer to MIT
Ritvick Pandey: or anything other us college
Ritvick Pandey: worst case you’ll be in IIT na
Ritvick Pandey: accha wait for transfer ull have to be in cs
Ritvick Pandey: haan then BITS seems more optimal
Ritvick Pandey: idk man i won’t be happy with BITS
Ritvick Pandey: and for <65
Ritvick Pandey: idk about u
Ritvick Pandey: but i’ll have to study hard as fuck
Ritvick Pandey: i know without studying hard as fuck i can get IIT
Ritvick Pandey: but for cs i’ll have to grind my ass off
Himir Desai: Within studying i get 250+ in allen ke Mains level test and advance ke jyada hue nai to i think ki padhunga to i will get into IIT for sure but the thing is i dont know i dont know achha I actually dont know my heart says no then its no so i will sleep

Himir Desai: Aaj i tried that and i did more work that i did in the last 2-3 days together
Ritvick Pandey: bhai ye kya baat huiye

Ritvick Pandey: moms are so irrational
Ritvick Pandey: youll have to study 25 hours a day

Ritvick Pandey: wtf!
Himir Desai: Array nahi i will give my mom 2-3 options to select what to do
Ritvick Pandey: ohhok
Himir Desai: Plus my mom wont do that and even if she did i would follow it. I just did this because i get confused what to do first

Himir Desai: Then wake up at 10
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: my mom asked me to fix my sleep schedule
Ritvick Pandey: last night when i was up till 3 na
Ritvick Pandey: i ended up not sleeping only
Ritvick Pandey: and then slept at 12pm
Himir Desai: My mom too and i explained her ki to wake up 1 hour early i will have to sleep 2 hours early so it wont help
Ritvick Pandey: i’m going to try this thing
Ritvick Pandey: it’s not well researched
Ritvick Pandey: so i’m not too sure
Ritvick Pandey: but i’ll split my sleep
Ritvick Pandey: into 3-3 hours
Ritvick Pandey: 3 at night
Ritvick Pandey: 3 in afternoon
Himir Desai: Kyuki in the morning I will feel sleepy and all to productivity gone
Ritvick Pandey: and see how it works
Ritvick Pandey: ideally if i’m splitting i’d want 4-4 but one REM cycle is 90 mins
Himir Desai: Unless i get a full nights sleep of 10 hours which will waste even more time
Ritvick Pandey: i could do 4.5-3 hours split
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll test this out
Himir Desai: I never ever sleep during daylight unless i am super tired
Ritvick Pandey: 11pm-330am
Ritvick Pandey: and 12pm-3pm
Ritvick Pandey: same, but i hadn’t slept only na since a day
Ritvick Pandey: if i can pull this off
Ritvick Pandey: the productivity will be INSANE
Himir Desai: Ha but isme i think ki after waking up each time your sleep wont be full to you will be sleepy for next hour
Ritvick Pandey: nahi thats the good part
Himir Desai: Also mere sleep ka indicator is my eyes if i dont sleep well one night next entire day my eyes water
Ritvick Pandey: if u wake up right after ur REM cycle na
Ritvick Pandey: then u wont feel sleepy
Ritvick Pandey: plus
Ritvick Pandey: we wont be that tired
Ritvick Pandey: cause we just got up 10 hours ago
Ritvick Pandey: and then we go to sleep again

Ritvick Pandey: i could list it as a summer project i did in class 9
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll show my engineering skills
Ritvick Pandey: and also it’ll actually help me
Himir Desai: I was thinking if i were him i would take my pillow and bury my face below it and continue sleeping
Ritvick Pandey: cmon
Ritvick Pandey: thay will definitely wake u up
Himir Desai: Ha it will but it will be very annoying
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll be awake no matter what
Ritvick Pandey: and after a few days my brain will wake up on its own to avoid being watered
Ritvick Pandey: plus i’ll just need to use for it a month
Ritvick Pandey: after a month brain will automatically wake up if i’ve been waking up at the same time daily
Himir Desai: Today i woke up to my alarm and i was surprisingly fresh
Ritvick Pandey: you must’ve slept
Ritvick Pandey: 6/7.5 hours
Himir Desai: I slept for 5 hours still i wasnt sleepy when i woke up
Ritvick Pandey: no way
Ritvick Pandey: chal im going to go buy
Ritvick Pandey: the items
Ritvick Pandey: required to make that
Ritvick Pandey: ill actually make it
Ritvick Pandey: im getting bored anyway
Himir Desai: Send me i video of it then after its done
Ritvick Pandey: ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: ill be unstoppable if its done
Ritvick Pandey: imagine having the power
Ritvick Pandey: to wake up whenever u want
Ritvick Pandey: only issue is the sticks might hit me in the face cause I move when I sleep
Ritvick Pandey: so I might have moved out of position
Himir Desai: Chal then i will give digital SAT ka practice test to get to know how much bad i am
Ritvick Pandey: okk
Ritvick Pandey: i also have to do that shit
Ritvick Pandey: theres nothing next to my bed but
Ritvick Pandey: idk where ill keep the items
Himir Desai: I will never be able to make that thing kyuki i sleep on king size bed (because it was made for me and my brother but now he is gone) and i wont wake up to water on my feet
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: same, meri didi jab idhar thi toh there was a bigger bed
Ritvick Pandey: abhi only I got this one
Ritvick Pandey: to match with my desk
Ritvick Pandey: yaar making it will take too much time
Ritvick Pandey: my motivation to make it went away
Ritvick Pandey: chal ill think of something similar
Ritvick Pandey: bye sat likh tu
Himir Desai: Ha i will first take some tips
Himir Desai: Kyuki english mai all options are similar so i suck not exactly but ab digital mai there would also be peoms so i will definitely suck
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: my English has always been good
Ritvick Pandey: so im not too scared
Ritvick Pandey: only time management will be an issue
Ritvick Pandey: uske liye ill have to practice 1-2 times
Himir Desai: Last time i gave SAT my highest was 1550 while practicing
Himir Desai: But that was paper pen wala
Ritvick Pandey: I had written PSAT for RSI
Ritvick Pandey: and I got 1510
Ritvick Pandey: it is out of 1520
Ritvick Pandey: i think
Ritvick Pandey: and i wrote with no practice
Ritvick Pandey: toh its fine only
Himir Desai: Mujhe to jyada practice karni padegi

Himir Desai: I am in washroom abhi to
Ritvick Pandey: raat ko msg karta hoon
Ritvick Pandey: hopefully i wouldve come up with something
Himir Desai: The score from an absolute point is bad but it is better than i expected kyuki this was my first time giving the digital SAT without any strategy or practice.
Himir Desai: Its 700 in english but most of the mistakes are because i rushed through the questions. I thought I wouldn’t get time so i did all the grammar questions fast without reading pura context and so got many of those wrong
Himir Desai: Also i will have to revise punctuation kyuki there were many questions jisme ;however, and , however, mai confuse hua

Ritvick Pandey: but i basically like building stuff
Ritvick Pandey: EXACTLY
Ritvick Pandey: ITS JUST
Ritvick Pandey: cool as fuck
Ritvick Pandey: to be able to create
Ritvick Pandey: what youre thinking of
Ritvick Pandey: in your head
Ritvick Pandey: hence i wanna become a mechanical engineer
Ritvick Pandey: mechatronics would be optimal
Ritvick Pandey: as it has mechanical, electrical and computer
Ritvick Pandey: so id acc be able to build a lot more
Ritvick Pandey: but its not available eberywhere
Himir Desai: I have subscribed to a blacksmith ka yt channel just for that
Ritvick Pandey: building something of your own is just exciting na
Ritvick Pandey: in Imperial ill see if i can also take AI
Ritvick Pandey: mechanical + AI would be too sick
Ritvick Pandey: build my own suit then add Jarvis to it (Jarvis iron man ka AI hai if u havent seen the movie)
Himir Desai: For me building is also exciting and all but i would like to do that as a hobby not career because i have heard ki making anything your career would erode your excitement slowl
Ritvick Pandey: plus i dont plan on doing a job either way, and even if i do it wont be a core engineering one so it doesnt matter what i choose
Himir Desai: You know when i said i want to make a boat its just things like that jo i want to do in my backyard
Ritvick Pandey: yes exactly
Ritvick Pandey: i wont build stuff
Ritvick Pandey: in my career na
Ritvick Pandey: ill make money otherwise
Ritvick Pandey: but when i have a a lot of money
Ritvick Pandey: and free time
Ritvick Pandey: then ill be able tos
Ritvick Pandey: sit in my lab
Ritvick Pandey: and build cool shit
Ritvick Pandey: for fun
Ritvick Pandey: with the knowledge i hold
Ritvick Pandey: of mech eng
Ritvick Pandey: my job wont be mech eng related
Ritvick Pandey: after mech eng u can go into anything u want
Ritvick Pandey: its the most versatile degree
Himir Desai: Achha
Ritvick Pandey: i could become - 1) investment banker, 2) some software guy  etc
Ritvick Pandey: plus
Ritvick Pandey: the good thing ab oxford is
Ritvick Pandey: in my bachelors
Ritvick Pandey: ill be doing engineering sciences
Ritvick Pandey: so ill learn all eng
Ritvick Pandey: not just mech
Ritvick Pandey: electrical and all too
Ritvick Pandey: so even more variety
Ritvick Pandey: whatever it is, my career wont be mech eng related
Ritvick Pandey: imagine weve made our billions
Ritvick Pandey: i want to be sitting in the basement of my home
Ritvick Pandey: working on cool shit
Himir Desai: Idk about my career i will see where it takes me abhi to its AI engineer mostly
Ritvick Pandey: ykwim
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: im hoping to have a startup idea by my 2nd  year bro
Ritvick Pandey: taaki by the time i dropout its successful asf
Ritvick Pandey: agar woh nahi hua
Ritvick Pandey: then ill do some job for 2 years
Ritvick Pandey: save up enough moneu
Ritvick Pandey: then quit and work on my compan
Ritvick Pandey: even that also doesnt happen
Ritvick Pandey: if*
Ritvick Pandey: then
Ritvick Pandey: ill go into finance
Ritvick Pandey: and be rich i guess
Ritvick Pandey: warna as i said
Ritvick Pandey: MBA
Ritvick Pandey: then high corporate job
Ritvick Pandey: waah
Himir Desai: Lots of options
Ritvick Pandey: mera house plan
Himir Desai: MBA ka US mai problem hai ki its not STEM to only 1 year OPT and only some colleges like stanford offer STEM MBA
Ritvick Pandey: yaar
Ritvick Pandey: but after an mba
Ritvick Pandey: dekh
Ritvick Pandey: im not going to be in a core eng job anyway
Ritvick Pandey: if i get a mba
Ritvick Pandey: from a place such as harvad
Himir Desai: You will just use one room anyways
Ritvick Pandey: harvard
Ritvick Pandey: see to get into harvards mba u need to have some career exp na
Himir Desai: Ha but H1B ka koi guarantee nahi na if you do from harvand or wherever it doesnt matter
Ritvick Pandey: after Harvard mba the avg salary is 250k usd
Himir Desai: 1 year OPT matlab only 1 H1B chance
Ritvick Pandey: it;l be much higher if i go into the same field which i had career exp in
Ritvick Pandey: so ill be straight to
Ritvick Pandey: vp/president level
Ritvick Pandey: then eventually CXO
Ritvick Pandey: and then ill be rich
Ritvick Pandey: wtf happened
Ritvick Pandey: tujhe bhi to mahal chahiye ta
Himir Desai: Ha maine kab na bola
Himir Desai: Mujhe bhi chahiye
Himir Desai: But mai to reality bata raha
Ritvick Pandey: if not that
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: see u have v good chance of a palace
Ritvick Pandey: 30% chance u become succesful
Ritvick Pandey: and 100% chance i become successful so ill j get u a palace
Ritvick Pandey: 💯💯
Himir Desai: 😂 sure
Ritvick Pandey: if i dont have a good home ill be constantly sad
Ritvick Pandey: even a penthouse in NY is good
Himir Desai: My didi ka apartment in new york is 6000 dollars per month and she shared with 3 others
Ritvick Pandey: in the early years id want a smaller house tho
Ritvick Pandey: like koi chotta sa villa type
Ritvick Pandey: 2 floors ho total
Ritvick Pandey: and fully white ho
Ritvick Pandey: later on when im a famous billionaire ill get a palace
Ritvick Pandey: haan bro thats the issue
Ritvick Pandey: all this is possible only if were rich
Himir Desai: I will come on weekends
Ritvick Pandey: which is why we need to be rich
Ritvick Pandey: peace
Ritvick Pandey: well build
Ritvick Pandey: cool shit
Ritvick Pandey: in my basement
Ritvick Pandey: do u think you will set in USA only
Himir Desai: Do you know Alex Labs youtube channel?
Himir Desai: I wish i do but i don’t know if i will
Ritvick Pandey: nahi
Ritvick Pandey: acch
Ritvick Pandey: wait also how come you wanna do comp sci? not cause u like comp sci gimme a real reason too
Himir Desai: He is a russian and is making a real iron man suit with arc reactor and all generating khud ki energy in the chest
Himir Desai: He did it by electrolysing water into H2 and O2 and then burning it
Ritvick Pandey: SEE this is the type of shit
Ritvick Pandey: i want to fuck around doing
Ritvick Pandey: and if im rich already money wont be an issue
Ritvick Pandey: wtf ye hai kaun?!?
Ritvick Pandey: ^
Himir Desai: I started coding when i was in 3rd or 4th grade and loved it ever since phir 5th se 7th tak there was a break and I didn’t code phir i picked it up in 8th again
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: so you want a job in that field only?
Ritvick Pandey: not a CXO type job
Ritvick Pandey: like tujhe actual ka kaam karna hai company ko manage karne ki jage
Ritvick Pandey: you could be both
Ritvick Pandey: being a founder of some company
Ritvick Pandey: that is what im hoping my career goes down as
Himir Desai: See for me job is just money making thing and i will use that money to do stuff to whatever gives me money i will do that i will start doing a job then as yoi said MBA ya phir i will so a MS ya MTech to advance to higher job roles in the same field
Himir Desai: Role*
Ritvick Pandey: accha ok
Ritvick Pandey: haan thats what I meant baicsally
Ritvick Pandey: that is ur end goal also money
Ritvick Pandey: or will u do cs jobs
Ritvick Pandey: for the "passion" of doing it
Himir Desai: Enough money is my end goal endless money isnt
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: my end goal is endless money
Ritvick Pandey: enough money is the least I should end up with
Ritvick Pandey: warna, as stated a lot of times Ill kms
Ritvick Pandey: unless I find the love of my life
Himir Desai: My passions change every year so i cant say that untill my bachelors gets over and i start doing an actual job
Ritvick Pandey: then life will be worth living
Ritvick Pandey: ideally I should have both, if not one I should have the other
Ritvick Pandey: makes sense
Ritvick Pandey: bhai ye dekh
Ritvick Pandey: fuck bro
Ritvick Pandey: penthouses in ny are too sexy
Ritvick Pandey: but theyre too expensive
Himir Desai: And atleast 10-20 million or even more
Ritvick Pandey: Mahal jitna cost karta hai

Ritvick Pandey: my college needs to be high tier
Ritvick Pandey: i cant go to a mid tier
Ritvick Pandey: ill be too embarassed
Ritvick Pandey: for the rest o fmy life
Ritvick Pandey: ED mai ill apply to Carnegie mellon mostly
Ritvick Pandey: i have lost hope in US colleges
Himir Desai: Mera i will have to discuss with the counsellor Caltech maybe
Ritvick Pandey: so ive stopped thinking about it
Ritvick Pandey: but why
Ritvick Pandey: think logically na
Ritvick Pandey: Caltech ka acceptance rate
Himir Desai: Oxford ka decision bhi jaldi ho aata hai 9th Jan
Ritvick Pandey: in regular decision
Ritvick Pandey: is 4%
Ritvick Pandey: in EA also its
Ritvick Pandey: less than 5%
Ritvick Pandey: theres no advantage
Ritvick Pandey: like in Carnegie mellon ED will give a 5% extra advantage
Himir Desai: I said i will have to discuss with couselor for this exact readon
Himir Desai: Reason*
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: jan ko mains bhi hoga
Ritvick Pandey: shit too much work
Ritvick Pandey: chal bye ja ke naha lo
Himir Desai: It will be after your decisions
Himir Desai: Wahi karne ja raha
Ritvick Pandey: Carnegie mellon would be respectable still
Ritvick Pandey: when I was a kid nothing under MIT
Ritvick Pandey: i would gag at the thought of it
Himir Desai: Wo bohot expensive hai but
Ritvick Pandey: now im having to degrade so much
Ritvick Pandey: as long as its education my dad doesnt mind paying
Himir Desai: As i kid i just watched doreamon and pokemon 😅
Ritvick Pandey: arey nahi
Ritvick Pandey: kid as in thodi later on
Himir Desai: I did this till 7th 💀
Ritvick Pandey: i wasnt allowed to watch
Ritvick Pandey: doraeomon
Himir Desai: 8th mai bui thoda
Ritvick Pandey: my family said nobita ko fail karte dekho ge tab tum bhi failure ban jaaoge
Ritvick Pandey: i used to watch shinchan so much
Himir Desai: 😂
Ritvick Pandey: 7th tak bhi, prime video pe
Ritvick Pandey: i miss those days
Ritvick Pandey: sube sube tv on karke
Ritvick Pandey: cereal khaate hue
Ritvick Pandey: kitna chill tha
Himir Desai: Those summers were so mast me and mera bhai would build contraptions race tracks for hot wheels and pura din maje hi maje
Himir Desai: Ha i did that too
Himir Desai: US mai jake first thing i am doing is buying a Nintendo Switch for pokemon games
Ritvick Pandey: do you think I should choose Purdue over IIT
Ritvick Pandey: Purdue is ranked 15 for mech eng , right after Harvard and before Caltech
Ritvick Pandey: but its acceptance rate is too high
Ritvick Pandey: 68,8%
Himir Desai: Mechanical ka acceptance rate kya hai
Himir Desai: 37
Ritvick Pandey: mechanical ka must be lower
Ritvick Pandey: but still
Ritvick Pandey: baaki sabka is so high
Ritvick Pandey: so I wont have the prestige
Ritvick Pandey: saying im from purdue
Ritvick Pandey: atleast with IIT in india ill get respect
Himir Desai: The thing is apply to the colleges and give JEE as well then decide you dont have to decide these thinga right now
Ritvick Pandey: nahi I do
Ritvick Pandey: bc if I wont chose purdue over IIT
Ritvick Pandey: then theres no point applying to the US AT ALL
Ritvick Pandey: caps by mistake
Ritvick Pandey: mera usa ka chance is almost null
Himir Desai: If you get into IITB Mechanical go there and in the second year transfer to MIT or somewhere
Ritvick Pandey: due to the 11th marks
Ritvick Pandey: so why even waste making a usa profile
Ritvick Pandey: hmm
Himir Desai: See after writing all my US essays UK ka task will be just to copy paste and submit the application nothing else
Himir Desai: Similarly
Himir Desai: For you also do US ka then UK ka will just be an hours job
Ritvick Pandey: hmm
Ritvick Pandey: dektha hoon
Himir Desai: IIT ka to padhna hi hai teri mom and meri mom wont give us any option
Himir Desai: Ab mai finally nahane jata
Ritvick Pandey: wahi toh
Ritvick Pandey: but iit is bad for everytthing
Ritvick Pandey: other than cs
Ritvick Pandey: like unka mech eng wont be good
Ritvick Pandey: placements will also not be good
Ritvick Pandey: bus tag milega
Ritvick Pandey: haan ja
Himir Desai: IIT B mech ka average is 20lpa why would someone go there
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: other iits itll be 4-5lpa
Ritvick Pandey: someone will make more as a swiggy driver
Ritvick Pandey: which is why I rlly dont want to go to IIT
Ritvick Pandey: wait wtf
Ritvick Pandey: o way
Ritvick Pandey: so I was seeing rankings
Ritvick Pandey: in eng and tech
Ritvick Pandey: and purdue is 25
Ritvick Pandey: above all ivies other than harvard
Ritvick Pandey: but guess what college is 50
Ritvick Pandey: ranked above
Ritvick Pandey: Columbia yale
Ritvick Pandey: edinbburgh
Ritvick Pandey: etc
Himir Desai: Software engineer ka OVERALL india mai average is around 8 lpa not even top colleges all over india and AI engineer ka all over india average is 10-15 (different websites) thats not even top colleges
Himir Desai: IIT?
Ritvick Pandey: yes wtf
Ritvick Pandey: iitb and iitd
Ritvick Pandey: I thought theyre in the 200s
Himir Desai: Senior AI engineer ka salary goes till 50lpa
Ritvick Pandey: no way
Ritvick Pandey: in india avg?
Ritvick Pandey: thats toooooooooo high
Ritvick Pandey: 50lpa in india avg
Himir Desai: Range maybe IQR
Ritvick Pandey: is like 5cr svg in other coutnry

Ritvick Pandey: its not looking too good
Ritvick Pandey: but its not bad at all either, as a good 12th score improvement along with a good score on their test should surely get atleast an interview
Himir Desai: If you get your school to give you good predicted then they will see a huge improvement and hence read the optional essay explaining bad marks where you will explain it to them
Himir Desai: To its not to difficult if you get good predicted
Ritvick Pandey: yes its not too difficult
Ritvick Pandey: I got the syllabus for the first test
Ritvick Pandey: continuity differentiability, linear programming and functions for math
Ritvick Pandey: physics electrostats and current
Ritvick Pandey: chem idk
Ritvick Pandey: but phy and math is easy 100%
Ritvick Pandey: anyways, goa kaisa hai!?
Ritvick Pandey: kidhar ho? north goa ki south goa

Ritvick Pandey: but then saw ur brothers hostel
Himir Desai: D hostel dekha hai?

Ritvick Pandey: but one called my home number
Ritvick Pandey: and my mom got a panick attack
Ritvick Pandey: that im talking to females and all
Ritvick Pandey: and then these girls started guilt tripping me
Ritvick Pandey: phir school ka lafda hogaya
Ritvick Pandey: leave
Ritvick Pandey: lmao that is sick
Ritvick Pandey: accha also I wanted your opinion on one thing
Ritvick Pandey: in this research program, ive been assigned this topic -
Ritvick Pandey: Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been known to be involved in the mechanism that causes numerous neurological disorders like migraine, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. In many cases when these events occur, the patient is usually asleep and not constantly connected to an EEG device to catch the spontaneous EEG activity spreading across the cortical surface. Design a low cost, portable device that patients can use at-home without interfering with their quality of life to perform real-time analysis of spontaneous brain waves that provides a warning towards neurological disorders warning patients to seek professional medical attention.
Ritvick Pandey: do you think I shud ask for a switch to a more math/phy related topic or that this is p cool
Ritvick Pandey: designing a portable device would help in mech eng
Himir Desai: Mai reply karta hu
Himir Desai: Abhi class mai hu
Himir Desai: I think that if you do do this and make a portable device which does all this it would be cool asf but you should also consider how much time it will take and will you be able to make one before the college applications
Himir Desai: Like i dont know how much time of your it will take. If it doesn’t take much then this would be a solid EC
Ritvick Pandey: hello
Ritvick Pandey: haan abhi I have started to focus very less time on ECs since usa is pretty much gone now

Ritvick Pandey: bro but
Ritvick Pandey: ill get too much backlog
Ritvick Pandey: ill have to go to school daily for around a month
Ritvick Pandey: so ill have to bunk 2 jee classes per day

Ritvick Pandey: I applied for IT committee president
Himir Desai: Is that easy
Himir Desai: I would never miss these many lectures
Ritvick Pandey: exactly im already covering like 50 missed ones
Ritvick Pandey: any role I apply to I will get for sure
Ritvick Pandey: except this one
Ritvick Pandey: because this one will have
Ritvick Pandey: this applicant
Ritvick Pandey: who has been part of committee for 7 years
Ritvick Pandey: and is also a relative of the main computer department teacher
Ritvick Pandey: but the other departments are useless for college applications, president of discipline committee, cultural committee, sports captain etc
Ritvick Pandey: how is your life going
Ritvick Pandey: college applicant wise
Himir Desai: WTF how and why did you miss 50
Ritvick Pandey: feb the course started
Ritvick Pandey: I missed entire feb

Himir Desai: Nahi kia 🥲
Ritvick Pandey: kiya nahi ya hua nahi?
Ritvick Pandey: time nahi mila toh ek baar try karlena
Ritvick Pandey: fun hai

Ritvick Pandey: over 11th
Ritvick Pandey: and i liked mechanics better
Ritvick Pandey: than 12th phy syllabus
Himir Desai: Coordinate geometry is faltu
Ritvick Pandey: chem mene dono nahi kiya toh nahi pata
Ritvick Pandey: sahi mai
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: text karna
Himir Desai: Ha
Ritvick Pandey: agar tujhse 1-2mins mai hogaya then I will be fuming
Himir Desai: Achha just tell me ki ye konse chapter ke theory se hoga because hamara abhi tak bas functions hua and and limits
Himir Desai: Itne mai se hi hai ki integration hai? Reiman hypothesis ya kuchh kyuki wo idi
Himir Desai: Idk*
Himir Desai: Aur ye i really dont know kya hai bas naam yaad aaya to likh diya if it has no relation to this question then it’s because mujhe naam ke alawa kuchh nahi pata
Himir Desai: Mai abhi Vn method try kar raha wo most probable lag rahi
Ritvick Pandey: dw uk everything required for this
Ritvick Pandey: functions aur 11th ka limits
Ritvick Pandey: and ofc im assuming yk wha factorial n sigma are
Ritvick Pandey: what*
Himir Desai: Done abhi bas likh kar answer nikal du
Ritvick Pandey: tujhe mai bahut marung
Ritvick Pandey: marunga
Ritvick Pandey: dikhao sol^n
Ritvick Pandey: fucking 2hrs I took
Ritvick Pandey: first I sat w the q for half n hr
Ritvick Pandey: then I took a 1hr break due to furstration
Ritvick Pandey: then again half n hour
Ritvick Pandey: tab hua
Ritvick Pandey: huh
Ritvick Pandey: final answer kya hia
Ritvick Pandey: ?
Himir Desai: Nikal raha hu
Ritvick Pandey: kk
Ritvick Pandey: (2n+1)! ke baad 2n! aata hai 2n+2 nahi
Ritvick Pandey: i dont understand what you wrote
Ritvick Pandey: but if this is what u wrote tab change karlena
Ritvick Pandey: thank god, agar tera hogaya hota itna jaldi, my ego would have been so hurt
Himir Desai: 2n+1 ke baad 2n+2 nahi aata?
Ritvick Pandey: nahi
Ritvick Pandey: dekh 2! mai,  2 ke baad 1 aata hai na
Ritvick Pandey: 2-1
Ritvick Pandey: similarly, 2n+1 ke baad 2n+1-1 aata hai
Ritvick Pandey: which is 2n
Himir Desai: Achha nahi i made a mistake ye 2n+1 2n wali nahi dusri i will have to solve that first
Himir Desai: Thats not what i did
Ritvick Pandey: accha, i didnt understand so i was just telling since i saw 2n+2
Ritvick Pandey: aaram se karlo
Ritvick Pandey: mai bhi qs kar raha hoon
Himir Desai: Are you sure data yahi hai?
Himir Desai: Ye 2n^2 + 2n + 1 hi hai na
Ritvick Pandey: han
Himir Desai: And answer is achha ki kharab? I mean integer and rational numbers are achhe
Ritvick Pandey: ruk ill write
Ritvick Pandey: the q
Ritvick Pandey: In clear terms
Ritvick Pandey: and send
Ritvick Pandey: cant say wont say i
Ritvick Pandey: maja aayega karna mai
Ritvick Pandey: mind fuck q hai na
Ritvick Pandey: ever since I did that days homework, my confidence for JEE has been shattered
Himir Desai: Achha okay
Ritvick Pandey: ill go to sleep after 10-15mins
Ritvick Pandey: agar solution bhejna hoga to bol dena
Ritvick Pandey: or else ill send tomorrow morning
Himir Desai: Send the solution
Ritvick Pandey: hello
Ritvick Pandey: text pe samajh nahi aa payega
Ritvick Pandey: call kar saktha hai?
Himir Desai: Ek baar solution bhej phir samaj nai aaya to call kar lenge
Himir Desai: Written hoga na?
Ritvick Pandey: phone dead hai na
Ritvick Pandey: toh answer text karna padega
Ritvick Pandey: ruk I had sent sol^n to my sir on whatsapp
Ritvick Pandey: forward karta hoon
Ritvick Pandey: nahi, pic se samajh aa jayega mostly
Ritvick Pandey: i meant on text itll be hard
Himir Desai: Achha okay
Ritvick Pandey: maine partial fraction Pehle kiya
Ritvick Pandey: then i found the expansion
Ritvick Pandey: but i had to rewrite properly to send to sir
Ritvick Pandey: so in reality, step 2 is step 1
Ritvick Pandey: and step1 was my step 2
Ritvick Pandey: since my writing is a bit confusing i have written what i did so as others can understand
Ritvick Pandey: so it should be fine
Ritvick Pandey: mind fuck q hai na
Himir Desai: Ha samaj gaya
Ritvick Pandey: accha chal im off to sleep
Ritvick Pandey: aur dimaag kharab karna hoga to boldena
Ritvick Pandey: mai bhej dunga
Ritvick Pandey: goodnight
Ritvick Pandey: this isnt that hard, but its pretty hard too
Ritvick Pandey: tu type kar raha hai kya
Ritvick Pandey: or is it a glitch
Himir Desai: Ye concept mujhe pata hai but hame officially ye integration mai sikhaenge. Allen ya atleast allen Vadodara mai bohot ulta sidha chalta like last year limits hame touch bhi nahi kiya wo abhi karaya similarly last year hamne organic touch bhi nahi kara wo bhi abhi shuru karaya hai
Ritvick Pandey: nahi i dont think ye concept padhayenge
Ritvick Pandey: this question se
Ritvick Pandey: sir removed the limits
Ritvick Pandey: to make it easier
Ritvick Pandey: so it was just a sequences question
Ritvick Pandey: aur koi concept nahi hai
Ritvick Pandey: partial fractions hai but woh toh 10th mai padthe hain
Ritvick Pandey: aur e^x ka expansion limits mai hai
Ritvick Pandey: warna its a sequence q
Himir Desai: Nahi i am talking about breaking the expression using that A B C thing
Ritvick Pandey: haan that is called partial fractions
Ritvick Pandey: woh integration mai nahi
Ritvick Pandey: 10th mai hota hai
Ritvick Pandey: humare liye deleted tha
Himir Desai: Allen Vadodara mai alag hi chalta
Ritvick Pandey: accha aisa kya
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe bhi nahi pata tha partial fractions, mere neighbour wale sir mujhe padhai the, earlier this year
Himir Desai: 10th mai ham TIM batch mai the to hame 11th ke and 12th ke basic concepts batae to 10th wala bas boards jitna kara
Himir Desai: Ye bata sahi ki galat
Ritvick Pandey: yaar
Ritvick Pandey: no way
Ritvick Pandey: mera bhi
Ritvick Pandey: yahie xact
Ritvick Pandey: aaya tha
Ritvick Pandey: but its wrong
Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭
Himir Desai: Achha then let me check
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: silly mistake hogaya tha mujhse
Ritvick Pandey: mene expand karke kiya
Ritvick Pandey: and i got ln 6/7
Ritvick Pandey: actually, 1 - 1/7 ke jage it is 1+1/7
Ritvick Pandey: what have u done I dont understand it
Ritvick Pandey: i hate logarithmic functions
Himir Desai: I messed with the signs
Ritvick Pandey: same
Ritvick Pandey: haan correc
Ritvick Pandey: correct
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: I did the same
Ritvick Pandey: i thought
Ritvick Pandey: u used some
Ritvick Pandey: shortcut log trick
Ritvick Pandey: which i dont know about
Ritvick Pandey: i skipped logarithmic functions in 11th
Ritvick Pandey: as i did nothing in 11th
Himir Desai: Nahi its just i did in my head (and so got the signs wrong)
Himir Desai: Mains level question even less
Himir Desai: Ye wala jo tha wo
Ritvick Pandey: i also screwed the sign initially
Ritvick Pandey: haan this wasn’t that bad
Ritvick Pandey: accha chalo goodnight
Ritvick Pandey: i have school tomorrow morning
Himir Desai: Ek aur koi bhej de phir sota hu
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO
Ritvick Pandey: ye karle
Ritvick Pandey: its not as mindfuck as the first one
Ritvick Pandey: but its p decent
Ritvick Pandey: i only couldnt do this because i had forgotten one expansion
Ritvick Pandey: agar tujhe yaad hai tab 1 min mai hojayega
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe hit karne mai 5mins laga
Himir Desai: Then look up you just need to know something like that exists not the pura formula formula you will automatically remember with practice
Ritvick Pandey: hmm
Ritvick Pandey: acha if you want more of the “mind fuck” wala section let me know i’ll send tomorrow morning
Himir Desai: Ha ok
Ritvick Pandey: abhi sone ja raaha hoon
Ritvick Pandey: iska solution bhej dena
Ritvick Pandey: perfect
Ritvick Pandey: I had forgotten basels problem
Ritvick Pandey: warna its easy
Ritvick Pandey: proud of u my friend, goodnight
Himir Desai: Ye sab naam kya hai ye yaad rakhne ki vajah se formulae bhul jate dimag mai storage limited hai waste na kari
Himir Desai: Karo*
Ritvick Pandey: I dont remember names ever!
Ritvick Pandey: hadn't I told u this
Ritvick Pandey: I dont remember anytihng ka naam
Ritvick Pandey: but basels problem is very famous
Ritvick Pandey: toh yaad rah gaya
Himir Desai: Not enough for ne to know its name
Ritvick Pandey: plus mene 10th mai kiya tha
Ritvick Pandey: so I forgot
Ritvick Pandey: 11th I didnt do shit na
Ritvick Pandey: 10th also I didnt, early 10th ya 9th end mai
Himir Desai: Achha tab to mai INJSO de raha rha tha jisme maths nahi aata to maths mera tab NCERT level hi tha
Himir Desai: Thike to so jate good night
Ritvick Pandey: hello
Himir Desai: Achha mujhe ekdum se yaad aaya why I didn’t know that partial fraction wala theory its because that entire thing is a waste of time and I do exactly the same thing everyday in my mind (the method I use is more of a repurposed method to do something else but it works really fast).
: 
 will tell you tomorrow mai kya karta hu: will tell you tomorrow mai kya karta hu
Ritvick Pandey: arrey same, I do a similar sort of thing in my mind which is why I always remember
Ritvick Pandey: like algebra also
Ritvick Pandey: when I was a kid
Ritvick Pandey: i did algebra
Ritvick Pandey: instead of x
Ritvick Pandey: i wrote
Ritvick Pandey: "something something"
Ritvick Pandey: also
Ritvick Pandey: i googled it
Ritvick Pandey: u and allen Vadodara were correct
Ritvick Pandey: partial fration integration ke saath phirse padhaya jaata hai
Himir Desai: Achha
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe neend nahi aa rahi
Ritvick Pandey: accha morning ko batana
Himir Desai: If i ask you to factorise x^3 + x^2 - x - 1 jiska one factor is (x-1) what will you do
Himir Desai: Kal dekhta hu
Ritvick Pandey: i will divide by x-1
Ritvick Pandey: and get the other factors
Himir Desai: Ha that is obvious but how will you divide
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO wdym
Ritvick Pandey: kal sube batana im too tired for this
Himir Desai: How will you divide
Ritvick Pandey: ye morning ki charcha hai
Himir Desai: Like bachpan mai long division sikhate the usse
Ritvick Pandey: i j divide it in my mind
Ritvick Pandey: technically
Ritvick Pandey: im using
Ritvick Pandey: long division
Ritvick Pandey: in my mind
Ritvick Pandey: so yes i guess?
Ritvick Pandey: i think i understand
Ritvick Pandey: what u say
Ritvick Pandey: ur going to do
Ritvick Pandey: kya tumhe pata hai this year Olympiads kab hoyenge
Ritvick Pandey: and if we write, will results come in time
Ritvick Pandey: or should we have written the 2022 one
Ritvick Pandey: prmo sept ko hoga na
Ritvick Pandey: shit
Ritvick Pandey: its too late
Ritvick Pandey: you've been typing since a while its scary
Himir Desai: Technically nahi jana hai. Like mai kya karta hu first I write (x-1)(
hen what should i put in bracket to get largest power of x in expression so it will be: hen what should i put in bracket to get largest power of x in expression so it will be
x-1)(x^2: x-1)(x^2
hen again next largest power is 2 jiska coefficient 1 hai but we already have -x^2 using -1 and x^2 to now i will add 2x to : hen again next largest power is 2 jiska coefficient 1 hai but we already have -x^2 using -1 and x^2 to now i will add 2x to
x-1)(x^2 + 2x: x-1)(x^2 + 2x
ow i have -2x extra but i need -x so i will add 1 to : ow i have -2x extra but i need -x so i will add 1 to
x-1)(x^2 + 2x +1) and everything done this is what i do and i get answer in 3-4 seconds: x-1)(x^2 + 2x +1) and everything done this is what i do and i get answer in 3-4 seconds
Ritvick Pandey: yes
Ritvick Pandey: this is
Ritvick Pandey: the logn
Ritvick Pandey: divison method na
Ritvick Pandey: this is what I mean, I do in my mind
Ritvick Pandey: btu technically
Ritvick Pandey: its long divison method
Himir Desai: Lot of low scoring students actually write down and do pura division
Ritvick Pandey: haan toh retards toh woh karenge na
Himir Desai: Its like long division but remainders you keep in mind
Ritvick Pandey: ya most of the avg log bhi
Ritvick Pandey: they fail off anyway
Ritvick Pandey: haan its not too tough
Ritvick Pandey: I dont see why dumb ppl also dont do this
Ritvick Pandey: likhne mai kitna time waste ho jayega
Ritvick Pandey: ive seen a similar thing
Ritvick Pandey: rationalise karte wakt bhi
Ritvick Pandey: people keep rewriting the entire thing
Ritvick Pandey: instead of simply substituting values if its not 0 anymore
Ritvick Pandey: u save like 30-40 seconds
Himir Desai: Maths mai to i skip majority if steps
Himir Desai: of*
Ritvick Pandey: same, but my sir has asked me to write down step by step
Ritvick Pandey: since he says
Ritvick Pandey: i will make mistakes
Ritvick Pandey: warna most of my math is incomprehendable
Ritvick Pandey: in/un ?
Ritvick Pandey: i j write 1-2 steps anywhere i find space
Himir Desai: aur iska matlab
Himir Desai: In
Himir Desai: Incomprehensible *
Ritvick Pandey: writing steps does help i suppose
Himir Desai: Exactly i gave 2 full jee papers in last month and people used 6-7 rough sheets and some even 10 sheets for the 75 questions jabki i used 0 i did everything in the qpaper itself
Ritvick Pandey: same!!
Ritvick Pandey: it’s weird how we do a lot of things alike
Ritvick Pandey: but my sir keeps telling me
Ritvick Pandey: thay i’m too stupid
Ritvick Pandey: to skip steps
Ritvick Pandey: and he knew some ppl at IIT
Ritvick Pandey: CSE wale
Ritvick Pandey: those were the ones who are allowed to skip sets
Ritvick Pandey: steps*
Ritvick Pandey: and he tells me how i’m not even close to cse level so i should write steps
Ritvick Pandey: then he hurts my ego a bit more
Ritvick Pandey: so i have started to try
Ritvick Pandey: this works so much better tho
Ritvick Pandey: answer is always correct + time is saved
Himir Desai: Our teachers are a lot less realist warma 90% population would be depressed kyuki they wont even get into IIT any field
Ritvick Pandey: fuck u mean realist
Ritvick Pandey: im not a retard
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO
Ritvick Pandey: hes just showing "tough love"
Himir Desai: I don’t know your teachers i am talking about mine
Himir Desai: Yeah
Ritvick Pandey: no i’m joking, you said your is a lot less realist, which implies mine is, but mine said i’m a retard
Ritvick Pandey: no but for real
Ritvick Pandey: my sir is a lot like us
Ritvick Pandey: plus i like him a lot since he’s always for real
Ritvick Pandey: woh directly muh pe chutiya bula dete hai
Ritvick Pandey: this i didn’t expect though
Ritvick Pandey: as far as i’ve heard they’re very rude in coachings
Ritvick Pandey: rude as in realistic
Ritvick Pandey: like they’ll straight up tell students they can’t get Iit
Himir Desai: They never do that here
Ritvick Pandey: i mean my perception is based off of a tv show (kota factory)
Himir Desai: They instead give other options like in addition to IITs also prepare for BITSAT VITEEE SRMJEE etc
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: my sir says if i write viteee he won’t claim me as his student
Himir Desai: I have not seen that but kota and Vadodara are different places kota mai i have been they can be harse here its nice and loving and all
Ritvick Pandey: the only college in india he is fine with other than IIT is BITS pilani
Ritvick Pandey: but that is probably because he’s from IIT
Ritvick Pandey: i’ve seen a lot of IITians have an obsession about
Ritvick Pandey: being from IIT
Ritvick Pandey: they base their entire life on that
Himir Desai: VITEEE is not a admission test its a fee reduction test kyuki even 50000 rank would get CS if he pays more
Ritvick Pandey: it’s like that for alot colleges
Ritvick Pandey: all here in Karnataka
Ritvick Pandey: they’re pvt and govt both
Ritvick Pandey: govt if u get seat
Ritvick Pandey: pvt if u don’t
Ritvick Pandey: like u can get PES from mains and have very less fees, or pay a lot and get in
Ritvick Pandey: but i don’t see a point in getting a btech from any of these colleges, engineers here are paid less than swiggy drivers
Himir Desai: Here Gujarat mai there are not a lot of high placement colleges i would even couns for one or two IIT Gamdhinagar mai utne achhe nahi there is one DAIICT usme thik thak hai
Ritvick Pandey: you know engineers are very well respect outside of india?
Ritvick Pandey: i was shocked
Himir Desai: Try
Himir Desai: True*
Ritvick Pandey: apparently when u tell ppl ur an engineer
Ritvick Pandey: they’re taken aback
Ritvick Pandey: and instantly respect you
Himir Desai: But computer science is not an engineering degree
Ritvick Pandey: since i’m from india and every 2nd person is an engineer i didn’t think it’s a big deal
Ritvick Pandey: respected*
Himir Desai: Outside of indiq
Ritvick Pandey: i’m talking about engineering in general not just cs
Ritvick Pandey: but there is computer engineering in a lot of colleges
Ritvick Pandey: in the US
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know how it’s different from cs but i know it is
Himir Desai: Ha ik i am saying ki CS isn’t engineering in USA
Ritvick Pandey: i didn’t bother checking
Ritvick Pandey: i think that is for hardware
Himir Desai: That is hardware atudf
Himir Desai: Stuff*
Himir Desai: UC Berkeley gives a BA in CS
Ritvick Pandey: hmm
Ritvick Pandey: wtf
Ritvick Pandey: that’s so
Ritvick Pandey: demeaning
Ritvick Pandey: 💀💀
Himir Desai: But majority give BSc or BS
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Ritvick Pandey: i want this one degree bro
Ritvick Pandey: it’s this
Ritvick Pandey: perfect program
Ritvick Pandey: but the course
Ritvick Pandey: isn’t available
Ritvick Pandey: in any decent college
Ritvick Pandey: mechatronics with
Ritvick Pandey: electrical mechanical and cs
Ritvick Pandey: uff 😩
Himir Desai: I found one excellent program which is computer science with business dual degree but that is also not available in good colleges (i will have to check though)
Ritvick Pandey: best i found so far in a good college is mechatronics (electrical+ mechanical+ entrepreneurship ) from purdue but it’s from purdue polytechnic university not a bachelors degree
Himir Desai: Then you get BSc and BBA
Ritvick Pandey: NTU!
Ritvick Pandey: it’s the hardest to get into course in NTU
Himir Desai: I am just talking about US
Ritvick Pandey: cs and business
Ritvick Pandey: oh ok
Ritvick Pandey: then i don’t know
Ritvick Pandey: i’m pretty sure
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be there in Stanford
Ritvick Pandey: it should be there
Himir Desai: I haven’t checked
Ritvick Pandey: stanford is famous for both
Himir Desai: SAT khatam hone ke baad i would be finalising my college list in 1-2 weeks
Ritvick Pandey: in fact, before Cs, economics was the most popular degree at stanford
Ritvick Pandey: i see
Ritvick Pandey: i’ve no time
Ritvick Pandey: bro reality checks
Ritvick Pandey: have hit me hard
Ritvick Pandey: no abroad colleges
Ritvick Pandey: and only 6 months for entire jee
Ritvick Pandey: i’m screwed bro
Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭💀💀
Himir Desai: Dont kill yourself though
Ritvick Pandey: no, that is if i’m not rich
Ritvick Pandey: so that is at 30
Ritvick Pandey: not now
Himir Desai: Have you seen IIMs?
Ritvick Pandey: and it’s very not probable
Himir Desai: Ya IISc?
Ritvick Pandey: IISc requires
Ritvick Pandey: <air200 in advanced
Ritvick Pandey: i’d rather do iitk cs
Himir Desai: That’s just IISc Bangalore
Ritvick Pandey: if i get <200
Ritvick Pandey: no see
Ritvick Pandey: any good indian college
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll have to finish
Ritvick Pandey: jee adv level syllabus
Ritvick Pandey: 11th and 12th
Ritvick Pandey: in 6 months
Ritvick Pandey: which i can do
Ritvick Pandey: but i really don’t want to
Ritvick Pandey: i still wanna apply abroad
Ritvick Pandey: even though there’s p much no chance
Ritvick Pandey: my best shot at abroad would be oxford, by acing the PAT
Himir Desai: But you would not prefer a lower (relatively) college abroad
Ritvick Pandey: no
Ritvick Pandey: lower as in
Ritvick Pandey: how low
Ritvick Pandey: i’m not applying to something like Penn state
Himir Desai: Uska department rank is good na
Ritvick Pandey: no yaar
Ritvick Pandey: everyone
Ritvick Pandey: gets accepted
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t wanna go to such a college
Ritvick Pandey: plus i’ll get trolled
Ritvick Pandey: by entire family
Ritvick Pandey: in UP
Ritvick Pandey: failures who can’t get indian college
Ritvick Pandey: go to a lower US college
Himir Desai: if you apply doesn’t mean you have to go but you must have some worst case safety measures
Ritvick Pandey: no like
Ritvick Pandey: if my halat
Ritvick Pandey: is as bad as penn state
Ritvick Pandey: then i won’t go to college only
Himir Desai: And then do pura JEE ka prep so that you can say no i wont come to your college on their faces
Himir Desai: And then you will be trolled as barvi pass
Ritvick Pandey: but that’s the issue na i don’t wanna do 14hiurs a day jee, and if i do then i don’t have time to apply outside
Ritvick Pandey: it’s better than
Ritvick Pandey: penn stated
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll j take gap year n apply next time
Ritvick Pandey: but it won’t get to that
Himir Desai: And penn state wale earn more than 12vi pass
Ritvick Pandey: see, lowest i can go is purdue, as my whole childhood i thought of purdue as a prestigious uni, and purdue is ranked 15 for mech
Ritvick Pandey: acceptance rate for purdue for mech is 30%
Himir Desai: Tab to you will have to apply to india only kyuki after gap foriegn college mai chance even kam
Ritvick Pandey: so even with shit 11th i’ll have a shot atleast
Ritvick Pandey: no if i take gap
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be for jee
Ritvick Pandey: so i’ll do CS at an IIT
Ritvick Pandey: but i rlly don’t wanna take a gap
Ritvick Pandey: my mom will make me want to kill myself
Ritvick Pandey: yar worst case i’ll go to BITS cs
Ritvick Pandey: if i am able to study atleast 6-7 hours a day
Himir Desai: Those fucking friends of yours have totally changed your future
Ritvick Pandey: worst case i’ll go to an IIT
Ritvick Pandey: i know bro it’s so
Ritvick Pandey: irritating
Ritvick Pandey: it fucking bothers me daily
Ritvick Pandey: fucking irritating ass fuckinf
Himir Desai: For me instead of a gap year i wiuld rather go to BITS CS
Ritvick Pandey: see with a 1570 SAT
9% in 12th: 9% in 12th
esearch papers etc: esearch papers etc
 should have a shot at atleast a georgia tech type uni: should have a shot at atleast a georgia tech type uni
Ritvick Pandey: or atleast they’ll be willing to hear reason of 11th duck up
Himir Desai: Georia tech is not super easy
Himir Desai: Assuming you get all this
Ritvick Pandey: research paper
Ritvick Pandey: is the only
Ritvick Pandey: thing
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t confirm
Ritvick Pandey: 12th won’t be hard ( i’m talking ab midterms not boards)
Ritvick Pandey: and SAT bhi hojayega
Ritvick Pandey: USA won’t care about boards na and 99 in midterms won’t be that hard
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be half the syllabus
Himir Desai: Just finish things na then why aait for the last moment SAT abhi de deni thi and should have closed that chapter
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know i’ll speak to a college counselor
Ritvick Pandey: and see
Ritvick Pandey: whay my options are
Ritvick Pandey: yar
Ritvick Pandey: i had completely
Ritvick Pandey: closed
Ritvick Pandey: USA ka chapter
Ritvick Pandey: but it’s too depressing
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t wanna study like a rat for 6 months
Ritvick Pandey: then go to iit
Ritvick Pandey: and study like a rat
Ritvick Pandey: for 4 more years
Ritvick Pandey: and then do some job
Himir Desai: For me midterms would be harder than boards kyuki our school gives very hard papers
Himir Desai: And checking is even harder
Ritvick Pandey: not like that bro
Ritvick Pandey: in midtemrs
Ritvick Pandey: limits continuity sifferentiability
Ritvick Pandey: linear programming
Ritvick Pandey: vectors
Ritvick Pandey: matrices
Ritvick Pandey: will come
Ritvick Pandey: it’s an easy 100
Ritvick Pandey: no matter how hard the marking is
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll speak to a college
ounselor: ounselor
Himir Desai: Hamare midterms mai most probably it would be Functions ITF Limit Conti. diff. MOD
Ritvick Pandey: i rlly wanna go to us
Ritvick Pandey: or atleast oxford/imperial
Ritvick Pandey: i can’t apply
Himir Desai: Where
Ritvick Pandey: to uni of edinburgh cs
Ritvick Pandey: either
Ritvick Pandey: since my essay will be mechanical based
Ritvick Pandey: and same essay goes to all 5 choices
Himir Desai: My counsellor said that for top tier colleges i should apply for data science instead of CS cause its easier and then after a year change Major
Himir Desai: UK mai not possible though
Ritvick Pandey: smart
Ritvick Pandey: can’t in UK tho
Ritvick Pandey: haan exactly
Ritvick Pandey: and i don’t wanna
Ritvick Pandey: try and bring in both
Ritvick Pandey: and mess up my chances
Ritvick Pandey: in both the places
Himir Desai: Mech ke liya itna pyar maine kisika nahi dekha
Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭😭
Himir Desai: Did you enjoy thats BITS ka mechanical workshop
Ritvick Pandey: no that was so shit
Himir Desai: That*
Himir Desai: Nahi not what we sid
Himir Desai: Did*
Himir Desai: What those students were doing
Ritvick Pandey: As a kid, I always had ideas for things I wanted to make or build, but I didn’t have the skills to do that. When selecting a major, I though ME would probably be the best choice to gain those skills.
Ritvick Pandey: this best describes my condition
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t have much interest in studies i just enjoy math and physics, i’m not going into those fields, as i don’t wanna be poor
Ritvick Pandey: i enjoy building things ( which is why ME is good )
Himir Desai: For example
Ritvick Pandey: if i’m doing a job i want to be at a managerial position
Ritvick Pandey: so i won’t do
Ritvick Pandey: a core engineering job anyway
Ritvick Pandey: which is why ME is perfect
Ritvick Pandey: if not anyways i’ve imagined me building my own company
Ritvick Pandey: for that also, engineering shud give me a good base
Ritvick Pandey: to have enough knowledge
Ritvick Pandey: to start a company
Ritvick Pandey: hence, Mech
Himir Desai: It is well known ki engineers dont know how to manage companies (in india)
Ritvick Pandey: it’s well known
Ritvick Pandey: ki engineers
Ritvick Pandey: do know
Ritvick Pandey: how to manage companies
Ritvick Pandey: idk about info
Ritvick Pandey: india*
Ritvick Pandey: the worlds richest people are engineers
Ritvick Pandey: not doing what they majored in
Himir Desai: Nahi hamare math sir allen Vadodara centre head he did his engineering then Management from IIM then he did lots of company mai kaam
Ritvick Pandey: most of the engineers are at a managerial position and not doing their core job such as my dad
Ritvick Pandey: same my dad did
Ritvick Pandey: engineering then IIM se management
Himir Desai: And he always tells us ki you should do a management degree after engineering kyuki engineering will give you the knowledge of how to make things but not how to make profit
Ritvick Pandey: bro but
Ritvick Pandey: if i’m from a reputed college
Ritvick Pandey: in india IIT
Ritvick Pandey: companies like mckinsey
Ritvick Pandey: directly pick up IITians
Ritvick Pandey: and give managerial roles
Ritvick Pandey: and abroad also, even in finance fields, they pick up engineers cause they’re smart, and just teach them the basics themselves
Ritvick Pandey: rather than getting a finance guy
Ritvick Pandey: so my job dream isn’t mech related
Ritvick Pandey: like how urs is CS related
Himir Desai: But then my dad isnt from IIT and he makes crores per year my friends dad isnt from IIT and he makes crores every year
Ritvick Pandey: ofcourse if i get an idea and build a cool enough product for a company then it’ll be mech related warna no
Ritvick Pandey: both ppl
Ritvick Pandey: are making crores
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t see the
Ritvick Pandey: plint
Ritvick Pandey: did u mean iit wala isn’t
Himir Desai: both aren’t from IIT
Ritvick Pandey: see same with my dad, he’s not from IIT but he’s making crores
Ritvick Pandey: but
Ritvick Pandey: the ratio
Ritvick Pandey: of non iitians making crores
Ritvick Pandey: is v less
Ritvick Pandey: with ratio of non iitians making fuckall
Himir Desai: I mean IIT is not everything you cam still make crores but the mehnat will increase
Ritvick Pandey: like sir was teling me
Ritvick Pandey: exactly
Ritvick Pandey: why increase
Ritvick Pandey: the mehnat
Ritvick Pandey: one of his friends got picked up my this stock company in canada
Himir Desai: Our sir has a law of conservation of mehnat if you dont want to do mehnat in future study 12 hours like a rat right now
Ritvick Pandey: alot got picked up by petroleum companies like schlumberger
Ritvick Pandey: for a crore
Ritvick Pandey: and in 2000s that was mad
Ritvick Pandey: LMAO no way
Ritvick Pandey: MY DIR SAID
Ritvick Pandey: the same exact thing
Ritvick Pandey: he said there is a law of conservation of mehnat
Ritvick Pandey: u do now and then do in IIT
Ritvick Pandey: and then relax
Ritvick Pandey: or do now don’t do in iit do a little later on
Ritvick Pandey: etc etc
Himir Desai: Then how can you not expect mehnat in future also not do mehnat right and and still earn crores
Ritvick Pandey: anwyays
Ritvick Pandey: no i will do
Ritvick Pandey: mehnat
Ritvick Pandey: in 4 years of college
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t mind right now also
Ritvick Pandey: i just don’t like
Ritvick Pandey: the Jee way
Ritvick Pandey: and would rather do mehnat for US colleges
Himir Desai: IITs mai bhi its the same way only maintaining GPA and all
Ritvick Pandey: ?
Ritvick Pandey: no in college
Ritvick Pandey: no matter what
Ritvick Pandey: my life will be fucked
Ritvick Pandey: and i’m fine with that
Ritvick Pandey: but i’m saying
Ritvick Pandey: i’d rather prep for US colleges then IITs
Ritvick Pandey: even tho my 11th is fucked
Ritvick Pandey: leave, it’s an endless topic of discussion with no solution
Ritvick Pandey: only option is to do IIT since US is gone
Himir Desai: When I was in 7th 8th i though ki when i will get in 11th i will leave SS and Hindi and Sanskrit and only Maths and Science life would get so much easier and it didn’t.
bhi i think ki when i go to college i will do all the subjects i love it would be so much easier but will it be: bhi i think ki when i go to college i will do all the subjects i love it would be so much easier but will it be
Ritvick Pandey: wdym? only sci is so much more peaceful
Ritvick Pandey: i fucking hated hindi
Ritvick Pandey: fucking chutiya subject
Himir Desai: Ask yourself again are you at peace right now ki when you were in 7th
Ritvick Pandey: in an ideal world, in college i’d take-
ngineering physics  or: ngineering physics  or
hysics or: hysics or
ath or: ath or
tatistics or: tatistics or
echanical and cs: echanical and cs
Ritvick Pandey: and be happy studying
Ritvick Pandey: that isn’t a fair comparison
Ritvick Pandey: imagine hindi right now, with the same increase in toughness PCM had
Ritvick Pandey: compare
Ritvick Pandey: in 7th only
Ritvick Pandey: only PCM in 7th
Ritvick Pandey: or PCM hindi in 7th
Ritvick Pandey: see if we were in US we’d be bless
Ritvick Pandey: we’re only struggling
Ritvick Pandey: since we’re Indians
Ritvick Pandey: which is why we’re not at peace
Himir Desai: My point is that its not that in future life would get easier or harder its just that the hardness will change its source so waiting ki future mai it will be easy tab i will do full mehnat is nit the way
Ritvick Pandey: or else in an european country our life would be better off with just math n science in 12th
Ritvick Pandey: im not saying
Himir Desai: We deal with what we have
Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be easy in future yaar
Ritvick Pandey: ur not understanding
Ritvick Pandey: no matter where i go, or what it is, 4 years of hardwork is there no matter what
Ritvick Pandey: so i will do it
Ritvick Pandey: in college
Ritvick Pandey: but right now
Ritvick Pandey: there is an option
Ritvick Pandey: 6 month of fuckallness
Ritvick Pandey: for 4 years of indian college
Ritvick Pandey: or 6 months of enjoyable abroad mehnat
Ritvick Pandey: for 4 years of usa college
Ritvick Pandey: i’d choose this
Ritvick Pandey: over this
Ritvick Pandey: solely because i like the outcome more
Ritvick Pandey: and because i don’t like mugging like a rat 24-7
Ritvick Pandey: like doing ECs, writing Essays, acing school exams OR JEE
Ritvick Pandey: i’d rather do the first option
Ritvick Pandey: is what i’m saying
Himir Desai: What about the chances of you getting that outcome if you do fuckallness/majedar mehnat
Ritvick Pandey: and now i don’t have enough time to do both
Ritvick Pandey: for an IIT, i need to do ONLYjee now
Ritvick Pandey: if i started in 11th i could do both, now it’s too late
Ritvick Pandey: so i have to choose one
Ritvick Pandey: exactly that’s the issue
Ritvick Pandey: i won’t get US college even if i do that
Himir Desai: You have 1 year for IIT because JEE main mai to bas >90%ile lana hai
Ritvick Pandey: so my only option is jee
Ritvick Pandey: no bro
Ritvick Pandey: jan mai mains
Ritvick Pandey: then boards
Ritvick Pandey: then mains again
Ritvick Pandey: oreboards
Ritvick Pandey: etc etc
Ritvick Pandey: too much
Ritvick Pandey: work
Ritvick Pandey: for me to do iit prep
Ritvick Pandey: so i’m only counting
Ritvick Pandey: 6 serious months
Ritvick Pandey: ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: if i leave

Ritvick Pandey: it won’t don’t worry
Ritvick Pandey: banaya tha
Ritvick Pandey: abhi, toh remake karna padega na
Ritvick Pandey: tu shuru karne wala hai na?
Ritvick Pandey: abhi toh*
Himir Desai: Esa hai ki mai jo consultancy se kar raha unhone list to bheja hai 40 colleges ka usme se 15 shortlist karni and khud ka add karna ho to kar sakte ab in 40 mai se 20 top colleges hai under dream category and bachi hui 20 pragmatic and safe mai divided hai
Himir Desai: Mujhe 8 jitne dream 3-4 pragmatic and 2 safe choose karni
Himir Desai: But jo safe hai to ghatia hai sab ki sab
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Himir Desai: Safe wali mai best 2 virginia tech and penn state hai
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll apply to 5 dream 1 reach
Ritvick Pandey: reach shayad add karu aur
Ritvick Pandey: do you recommend joining a consultancy
Himir Desai: Phir reach mai thik thak hai kuchh kuchh like UCI UCD Purdue par wo bhi thik thak hi hai khas nahi
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: for me purdue would be blesssss
Ritvick Pandey: but i don’t think it’s good for CS
Ritvick Pandey: purdue is the only “reach” i’ll be applying to
Ritvick Pandey: mere phy sir took unit test type test
Himir Desai: See consultancy is mostly to save time like mere college list unhone banae and wo naya gmail banaenge and application bhi wo hi bharenge my kaam would just be to give them details and essays
Ritvick Pandey: and i got 100%
Ritvick Pandey: so i’m getting more hopeful
Himir Desai: Essays mai bhi i will write the essay with a essay editor on a zoom call and wo essay editor is actually good
Ritvick Pandey: accha
Ritvick Pandey: how much does a consultant cost
Ritvick Pandey: mere papa ko link bhejdunga payment ka, woh abhi wapas US gaye
Ritvick Pandey: this is the main reason i’ll need cs consultancy
Ritvick Pandey: need a consultant*
Himir Desai: Mera wala to bhayankar expensive hai 150000 but saste wale bhi honge
Ritvick Pandey: bhai
Ritvick Pandey: that’s so good
Ritvick Pandey: idhar zyada hai
Ritvick Pandey: mera ek friend ka 5L hai
Himir Desai: Mai agar 10 din late gaya hota to pura payment 2K notes mai karta par abhi 500 mai kar diya
Ritvick Pandey: and he’s doing since 9th grade
Ritvick Pandey: guess for what college
Himir Desai: Here from 9th grade karna ho to it was 250000
Himir Desai: Idk mit? Purdue?
Ritvick Pandey: 20Lakh in consultancy for UCLA🤣🤣🤣
Himir Desai: 5L per year💀
Ritvick Pandey: UCLA aur USC ke liye
Himir Desai: UCLA is good for CS USC idk
Ritvick Pandey: i used to troll him so much, but now with my 11th score i can’t get UCLA also
Ritvick Pandey: he doesn’t wanna do CS
Ritvick Pandey: it’s for some chutiya course
Ritvick Pandey: i forgot which
Ritvick Pandey: UCLA is v good for cs
Himir Desai: UCLA ka acceptance is 11%
Ritvick Pandey: i talked to this
Ritvick Pandey: i saw this year
Ritvick Pandey: when talking to that
Ritvick Pandey: bhaiya from UCLA
Ritvick Pandey: but for some reason
Ritvick Pandey: i had the image
Ritvick Pandey: of UCLA
Ritvick Pandey: as a party school
Ritvick Pandey: so i used to laugh why someone would do sm for a party school
Himir Desai: Wo bhi achha hai
Himir Desai: UC ab to accept nai karti SAT par pehle it was 1360-1550 international ke liye take the upper limit as baseline
Himir Desai: West, Midwest, east ye sab location of job in US hai
Himir Desai: mid west mai I think they forgot something like ek zero dalna reh gaya hoga
Ritvick Pandey: bro
Ritvick Pandey: purdue is
Ritvick Pandey: top class
Ritvick Pandey: mech ka
Ritvick Pandey: is 100k
Ritvick Pandey: avg
Ritvick Pandey: for cs it’s eh
Ritvick Pandey: but these placements
Ritvick Pandey: look sexy
Ritvick Pandey: thays why i’m shocked at the
Ritvick Pandey: acceptance rate
Himir Desai: cs mai they said 105K is lowest but I think that is some stats game they played but still
Ritvick Pandey: my whole life i’ve thought of it as a prestigious selective uni
Ritvick Pandey: my dad also thinks very highly of purdue
Ritvick Pandey: and he only thinks like this for MIT carnegie melon and all
Himir Desai: purdue ka hi itna mai MIT CMU dekhke to maja aa jaega
Ritvick Pandey: itna hi hoga
Ritvick Pandey: actually no
Ritvick Pandey: for CS idk
Himir Desai: to matlab kya MIT jane ka
Ritvick Pandey: but for mech itna hi hai
Ritvick Pandey: 🤣🤣🤣
Ritvick Pandey: in fact out of all these colleges
Ritvick Pandey: which ice gone through
Ritvick Pandey: several times
Ritvick Pandey: highest placement is of guess what
Ritvick Pandey: MIT cs graduates ka itna hai
Himir Desai: ice gone through??
Himir Desai: isme kuchh locha hai i just read somewhere median salary is 150K
Ritvick Pandey: ive *
Ritvick Pandey: yaar it’s MITs own website
Himir Desai: nahi i mean ye undergrad salary report nai kuchh aur hoga warna MIT should be nuked for giving 50K and taking 200K fees
Ritvick Pandey: graduate hai
Ritvick Pandey: undergrad nahi
Ritvick Pandey: grad school matlab
Ritvick Pandey: post grad
Ritvick Pandey: na
Ritvick Pandey: median of MIT cs undergrad is 110-120k
Ritvick Pandey: it was 2 years ago when i did thorough research
Himir Desai: bhai to go to MIT for post grad and reduce salary by 100K nice offer
Ritvick Pandey: na
Ritvick Pandey: a lot who would’ve went
Ritvick Pandey: would have gone to some shitty undergrad
Ritvick Pandey: if u do mit undergrad and postgrad
Ritvick Pandey: then obv salary will be a lot higher
Himir Desai: but isn't mit ashamed of writing 50K on their website
Ritvick Pandey: post grad wale don’t make a lot in general
Ritvick Pandey: most of them atleast
Ritvick Pandey: they go into
Ritvick Pandey: research
Ritvick Pandey: yaar i used to like purdue
Ritvick Pandey: u have rhined it
Ritvick Pandey: for me
Ritvick Pandey: saying  saare chutiye jaate hain
Ritvick Pandey: accha mai kha ke baat karta hun
Himir Desai: achha what salary figure you consider good first year after finishing undergrad
Ritvick Pandey: i’ve seen this exact question
Ritvick Pandey: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ritvick Pandey: i’m in public laughing out loud at ur texts
Ritvick Pandey: anything under 100k usd is unacceptable
Himir Desai: Ha that is to also the case for me i just thought from your texts ki you want some 500K starting salary
Ritvick Pandey: i mean yes
Ritvick Pandey: that is preferable
Ritvick Pandey: but minimum i’d go is 100k
Ritvick Pandey: bro college w
Ritvick Pandey: highest placements
Ritvick Pandey: not highest median
Ritvick Pandey: not highest average
Ritvick Pandey: but college with highest placements
Ritvick Pandey: was IIT Kanpur
Ritvick Pandey: u didn’t answer when i asked to guess
Himir Desai: I thought you asked to guess where your friend wanted to go and paid 20Lacks
Himir Desai: Lakhs*
Ritvick Pandey: anyways
Ritvick Pandey: IITk is the answer
Ritvick Pandey: accha bye my mom is scolding for being on my phone
Himir Desai: Achha okay bye ttyl
Ritvick Pandey: hello
Ritvick Pandey: i’m in car now
Ritvick Pandey: haan iit kanpur has the bighest ever placements
Ritvick Pandey: 500k usd
Ritvick Pandey: sick as fuck
Ritvick Pandey: but the highest EVER is probably from harvard or MIT only
Himir Desai: what i always think of india vs us is that us is wait i will send you a graphic
Ritvick Pandey: na but
Ritvick Pandey: iitk high placements
Ritvick Pandey: are in US only
Ritvick Pandey: not india
Ritvick Pandey: send send
Ritvick Pandey: your understanding is incorrect
Himir Desai: Then correct me
Ritvick Pandey: niche US
Ritvick Pandey: upar india
Ritvick Pandey: it’s not a continuous rise
Ritvick Pandey: it’s constant after some point
Ritvick Pandey: US ka starting is india ka ending constant value
Ritvick Pandey: but that is because having 1cr salary in india is like having 300k usd salary in USA
Ritvick Pandey: 200*
Ritvick Pandey: 200-300
Himir Desai: Array nahi i didnt went into that much detail what i just wanted to show is india mai majority very less minority super high (average salary wale bhi hai but they just barely live) US mai its more even distribution
Ritvick Pandey: ohhh
Ritvick Pandey: yours is
Ritvick Pandey: distribution of salaries?
Ritvick Pandey: my graph was
Ritvick Pandey: salary growth of a person
Himir Desai: Yeah it was distribution
Ritvick Pandey: acchaaa
Ritvick Pandey: mine is growth after college
Himir Desai: Na not growth wo to idk how it is in either contries
Ritvick Pandey: of an average individual
Himir Desai: Countries*
Ritvick Pandey: this is my distribution
Ritvick Pandey: yo india
Ritvick Pandey: up*
Ritvick Pandey: the lower y value of india will be a little longer
Himir Desai: Isme which is better i cant figure out
Ritvick Pandey: india mai the gap is huge between rich and average ppl
Ritvick Pandey: the average ppl are a lot more in number and are very poor
Ritvick Pandey: in usa the poor and average have a small gap
Ritvick Pandey: while there’s still plenty of rich
Ritvick Pandey: more accurate
Himir Desai: Mere jesa hi hai
Ritvick Pandey: no the thing is
Ritvick Pandey: in india
Ritvick Pandey: yes
Himir Desai: Ye india nahi general hai
Ritvick Pandey: this is mine
Ritvick Pandey: if you’re from a normal college
Ritvick Pandey: your starting salary and your salary when you’re 40 are very different
Ritvick Pandey: you might start off at 3-4 LPA
Ritvick Pandey: but with time you could come to crores
Ritvick Pandey: but then it becomes constant at 1/2cr
Ritvick Pandey: if you’re from a college like IIT your starting and ending salary doesn’t have a huge difference
Ritvick Pandey: for the average people ofcourse
Ritvick Pandey: for a hardworking person it’ll be a lot more
Himir Desai: Nahi na the thing in india is if you are not from IIT then instead of increasing your salary they will kick you and hire someone at lowet salary (if your skills are replaceable)
Ritvick Pandey: no that’s what
Ritvick Pandey: i’m saying
Ritvick Pandey: let me finish
Ritvick Pandey: this is
Ritvick Pandey: an exceptional non IITian
Ritvick Pandey: and this is an average IITian
Ritvick Pandey: the exceptional non IITian overtakes the average IITian
Ritvick Pandey: this happens to the average Non IITian
Ritvick Pandey: avg non iitian graph i’d say
Himir Desai: Ha sahi
Himir Desai: Par ye internet pe US college research is very difficult every website shows different dat
Himir Desai: Data*
Ritvick Pandey: ruk mai ghar pahuchke text karta hoon
Himir Desai: Ha thik hai
Ritvick Pandey: only check
Ritvick Pandey: the colleges own website
Ritvick Pandey: for placement statistics
Ritvick Pandey: in purdue
Ritvick Pandey: for mech eng
Ritvick Pandey: avg is 80k
Ritvick Pandey: higher side is 135k
Ritvick Pandey: means if i grind in college
Ritvick Pandey: i can get 135k starting
Ritvick Pandey: which is 1.1cr
Ritvick Pandey: that’s decent
Himir Desai: Ha but finding that is also very difficult ekto colleges ki websites are a maze usme bhi there are hidden links
Ritvick Pandey: haan
Himir Desai: Ha 135K would be a good starting salary 3 saal mai atleast 150-160K and isme bonus to alag se hoga
Ritvick Pandey: haan that’s what
Ritvick Pandey: in 3 saal
Ritvick Pandey: i should be at minimum 200k if i’m still working
Ritvick Pandey: which i won’t be
Ritvick Pandey: and once i hit the 200-300k wala range
Ritvick Pandey: and i can apply to a prestigious business school (harvard business) for mba
Ritvick Pandey: this is all if i don’t have a startup
Ritvick Pandey: the starting avg salary of a harvard mba guy is 200k, if you go into a field you already have experience in ( which i will ) then your salary is a lot higher
Ritvick Pandey: since my salary was alr 200k
Ritvick Pandey: after harvard mba
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll be straight into managerial positions
Himir Desai: And i have seen ki while getting a job there is a negotiation round jisme you can negotiate to increase your salary. And usme everyone says itni badha do itni badhado and they get a rise but not what they expect instead what i will do and what other smart people do is they ask for more paid leave and other benefits like health and transport and vacation allowance and all
Ritvick Pandey: so 300 no 400 no 500kish
Ritvick Pandey: it should be
Ritvick Pandey: and once you’re at such a level
Ritvick Pandey: there’s so many chances of growth
Himir Desai: Harvard MBA is stem?
Ritvick Pandey: i meant
Ritvick Pandey: if you go into a job field
Ritvick Pandey: you already have experience in
Ritvick Pandey: AFTER graduating
Himir Desai: Nahi i asked because non stem ko they give only 1 H1B chance
Himir Desai: Stanford MBA is stem that i know
Ritvick Pandey: idk what all that is bro
Ritvick Pandey: stanford MBA was always the choice
Ritvick Pandey: until recently
Ritvick Pandey: when i got to know
Ritvick Pandey: how much BANK these harvard boys make
Himir Desai: If its stem MBA then you get 3 H1B chances
Ritvick Pandey: still don’t know what that means
Ritvick Pandey: i mean i can make out a rough idea
Ritvick Pandey: but
Ritvick Pandey: no clue what ur saying
Ritvick Pandey: what the fuck is a
Ritvick Pandey: h1b chance
Himir Desai: You need to have a work visa to work in USA and uska naam hai H1B but to get it you have to go through a lottery jiske stem mai you get 3 chances and non stem mai 1
Ritvick Pandey: why are you stressing over VISA rn
Ritvick Pandey: it’s very easy to get
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t think
Ritvick Pandey: it’s a lottery
Ritvick Pandey: literally all the dfs ik
Himir Desai: It is
Ritvick Pandey: and normal ppl ik
Ritvick Pandey: are settled in usa working
Ritvick Pandey: one bhaiya, who studied at PES university
Ritvick Pandey: shifted to US for work
Ritvick Pandey: n bought a tesla and sent pic recently
Himir Desai: Nahi i am not stressing over visa H1B nahi mila then i will marry a US girl to uska to problem nai hai
Ritvick Pandey: ?
Ritvick Pandey: ???
Ritvick Pandey: that is the most
Ritvick Pandey: set
Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭😭
Ritvick Pandey: shreya’s
Ritvick Pandey: anyways*
Ritvick Pandey: if we’re from a prestigious uni
Ritvick Pandey: and are sick asf
Ritvick Pandey: company will offer us work visa bro
Himir Desai: And the girl i will marry would make some 100-200 K as well
Ritvick Pandey: or if we’ve worked good enough for long enough
Ritvick Pandey: company will offer work visa
Himir Desai: Uska hi naam hai H1B mere dost
Ritvick Pandey: my dads company keeps asking him to shift to US
Ritvick Pandey: my dad said he’ll be making 1M+ if he shifts
Himir Desai: Transfer will be an L1 visa
Ritvick Pandey: but he can’t
Ritvick Pandey: cause of my Grandparents
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t understand
Ritvick Pandey: i would take the money
Ritvick Pandey: INSTANTLY
Ritvick Pandey: sorry not 1m+
Ritvick Pandey: he said the home
Ritvick Pandey: will be 1m+
Ritvick Pandey: company will give some home
Ritvick Pandey: or something
Ritvick Pandey: i don’t rmeneber but it was something about a home being 1m+
Himir Desai: Some 350000 people apply and 100000 get H1B based on a lottery
Ritvick Pandey: he’s at US na so he was calling and telling but for some reason my parents don’t talk about money in front of me so my mom changed topic
Himir Desai: Because you dont have liabilities right now
Ritvick Pandey: he said the same exact thnig
Ritvick Pandey: what is in the list
Himir Desai: Which list
Ritvick Pandey: of your dream schools
Ritvick Pandey: tune bola na the consultancy made a list for you
Ritvick Pandey: i’m surprised your reach is UCD
Himir Desai: They are not “my” dream school its just a list of top schools labelled as dream universities. I have to select (or add) 7-8 for the final college list
Ritvick Pandey: haan haan i know
Himir Desai: Thats what they put it under she had 22 years ka experience in this so she must know
Himir Desai: Has*
Himir Desai: Wait laptop khol ke bhejta hu
Ritvick Pandey: okk
Ritvick Pandey: i’ll sit and make a list abhi
Ritvick Pandey: taking salary into consideration, i might add some tier 2 unis
Ritvick Pandey: with good placements
Ritvick Pandey: and maybe still apply to the US
Himir Desai: I started the college research niche se to i checked all the safe ones first and they are faltu i would rather go to BITS Pilani than those
Ritvick Pandey: i would go to BITS over UCD and all also
Himir Desai: BITS ka highest is 40 lpa some (goa) and pilani mai i would not go kyuki waha extreme weather and abhi to due to water shortage they have sent students to their homes to do online study
Ritvick Pandey: im talking about pilani
Ritvick Pandey: and 50-60 lpa is a lot in india
Ritvick Pandey: + youre not taking reputation into consideration
Ritvick Pandey: growth will be a lot easier if youre a bits pilani alumni
Ritvick Pandey: if you say ur from UCD no one will gaf
Ritvick Pandey: bits pilani will get u respect ( in india atleast)
Himir Desai: 4 saal it will he difficult to stay there
Ritvick Pandey: but ur condition wont reach UCD level anyway
Ritvick Pandey: dekh na
Ritvick Pandey: once u goa
Ritvick Pandey: go*
Ritvick Pandey: and start having fun
Ritvick Pandey: time will fly by
Ritvick Pandey: jaise YEB mai
Ritvick Pandey: it got over in a minute
Ritvick Pandey: even though it was
Ritvick Pandey: the shittiest room
Ritvick Pandey: ive stayed in
Ritvick Pandey: in my entire life
Himir Desai: Ha but the catch is you cant go maine bola na this year they sent all students home due to extreme garmi my brothers classmate is there so i know
Himir Desai: And water is also limited
Ritvick Pandey: im not
Ritvick Pandey: talking about
Ritvick Pandey: goa bhai
Ritvick Pandey: i mean
Ritvick Pandey: main pilani campus
Himir Desai: Nai pilani mai wapas bhej diya ghar
Himir Desai: Goa mai kaha garmi hai
Ritvick Pandey: hain?!?
Ritvick Pandey: u said brothers classmate
Ritvick Pandey: so i thought
Himir Desai: Agar I that was garmi to pilani mai to it goes 50C
Ritvick Pandey: bits goa classmate
Himir Desai: Nahi school wala
Ritvick Pandey: bhai wtf
Himir Desai: And 10 at night
Himir Desai: Winters mai 0 bhi jata

Ritvick Pandey: 45
Ritvick Pandey: and all
Ritvick Pandey: in march
Ritvick Pandey: thats fucked up
Ritvick Pandey: but id still take
Ritvick Pandey: bits pilani cs
Ritvick Pandey: over ucd
Himir Desai: Achha wait i was typing something for this
Ritvick Pandey: karlo type
Himir Desai: Yeah sure but lets say if you have a decent 200K sal (after 2-3 years) and achha sa ghar hai phir masters karlo 250-300 ho gai phir shanti se jivan jiyo i am different than you here i dont want multi million salary if i have a happy life ofc i will put efforts to increase salary to a million in 10ish years plus MBA karunga then even more
Himir Desai: I am not saying BITS mai ye possible nahi
Himir Desai: BITS mai bhi you can do same masters kar lo US top college mai then set
Himir Desai: I am not defending UCD over BITS i might as well go to BITS over UCD but i will not create any preconceptions right now
Ritvick Pandey: yes exactly
Ritvick Pandey: this si what i mean
Ritvick Pandey: multi millionsalary is not possible/ or atleast easy with any of these 2
Ritvick Pandey: but
Ritvick Pandey: this
Ritvick Pandey: is much much mroe probable
Ritvick Pandey: with bits pilani cs
Ritvick Pandey: than UCD
Himir Desai: BITS Pilani CS mai you wont get 200K
Ritvick Pandey: after 3-4 years
Ritvick Pandey: u can
Ritvick Pandey: easily
Ritvick Pandey: sahi mai
Himir Desai: Also BITS Pilani CS is not as easy as you might think
Ritvick Pandey: see, what im thinking is, anyone who has a good 100k+ package can grow to 200 over time
Ritvick Pandey: and with bits pilani cs u can get that 100k in an year
Ritvick Pandey: i dont think its easy at all
Himir Desai: UCD se to kai guna tough
Himir Desai: Mainly because chem is all factual Math mai only a minute per question physics not much of an issue english mai they will ask any random arrangement of letters word ka synonym MA will be mindfuck too
Himir Desai: MA-> mental ability/ logical reasoning
Ritvick Pandey: i know
Ritvick Pandey: mujhe pata hai ye sabkuch
Ritvick Pandey: im just tellnig you
Ritvick Pandey: if i had the choice
Ritvick Pandey: id take bits cs
Ritvick Pandey: ANYDAY

Ritvick Pandey: accha this may sound
Ritvick Pandey: weird
Ritvick Pandey: but one thing i do
Ritvick Pandey: is check
Ritvick Pandey: richest alumni of each college
Ritvick Pandey: for bits pilani richest is 300mil net worth
Ritvick Pandey: for uc davis its 10mil
