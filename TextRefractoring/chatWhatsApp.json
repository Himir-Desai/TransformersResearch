Therefore, candidates will normally have two separate interviews, and if there is any preliminary reading to go along with the interview it will usually be e-mailed to your academic referee. It is a misconception to believe that those interviewing over Skype are at a disadvantage as compared to those interviewed in-person,  and should not be a reason to worry for any applicants. If you’re invited to interview at any college, you will be provided with further guidelines for an online interview, which will generally require you to organise that the interview takes place in your current academic institution.\n"
