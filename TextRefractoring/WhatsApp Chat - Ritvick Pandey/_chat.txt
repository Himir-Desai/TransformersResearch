[17/03/23, 3:06:36 PM] Ritvick Pandey: bro we cant take in everyone who is interested from the group, but i dont want to say anything eihter
[17/03/23, 3:06:59 PM] Himir Desai: yeah thats why i am being silent
[17/03/23, 3:07:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hmm
[17/03/23, 3:08:41 PM] Himir Desai: we can do some research from some local college actually in vadodara there is a Maharaja Sayajirao University (very well reputed here) maybe we can get help from them because they are not too big and neither it is too small
[17/03/23, 3:08:47 PM] Himir Desai: it is funded by the king here
[17/03/23, 3:09:53 PM] Ritvick Pandey: bro lets set a time for tmrw and then call, we can add another person too
[17/03/23, 3:09:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yeah we need colleges like that
[17/03/23, 3:10:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: theres 2-3 in blr, where i live
[17/03/23, 3:10:26 PM] Himir Desai: yeah we will request all of them atleast one will reply
[17/03/23, 3:11:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: well formulate a plan
[17/03/23, 3:11:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: our best shot is at BITS
[17/03/23, 3:11:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: even if they dont take us, im pretty sure they'll atleast guide us on what to do
[17/03/23, 3:11:56 PM] Himir Desai: yeah we can go there ask some professors for guidance and then we can conduct our research from a nearby theek thaak college
[17/03/23, 3:12:10 PM] Himir Desai: i will tell you the time in some time
[17/03/23, 3:12:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan, plus were also going to interact with the mars rover and Astro club
[17/03/23, 3:12:25 PM] Ritvick Pandey: im sure there'll be some students in those clubs doing research currently
[17/03/23, 3:12:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we can ask for help too
[17/03/23, 3:12:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: badhiya
[17/03/23, 3:12:40 PM] Ritvick Pandey: see you tomorrow bro

[17/03/23, 3:12:45 PM] Himir Desai: bye
[17/03/23, 3:12:47 PM] Himir Desai: thanks
[17/03/23, 3:13:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: Ok also my dad is in the education business and can probably connect us to a professor so if that’s easier we could do that too
[17/03/23, 3:13:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we found a partner
[17/03/23, 3:14:00 PM] Himir Desai: yeah lets talk to her tomorrow till then you can msg her
[17/03/23, 3:14:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ill just do it tmrw, just in case some other dude is there in the group who sees the message at night and can prove to be a lot more helpful
[17/03/23, 3:14:41 PM] Himir Desai: yeah yeah
[18/03/23, 2:37:36 PM] Himir Desai: At what time you are feee today
[18/03/23, 2:40:40 PM] Ritvick Pandey: anytime after 7
[18/03/23, 2:40:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that works for you?
[18/03/23, 2:40:53 PM] Himir Desai: Yeah it will
[18/03/23, 2:41:10 PM] Himir Desai: Found anyone?
[18/03/23, 2:41:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: cool see you then
[18/03/23, 2:41:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: from the bits group?
[18/03/23, 2:41:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: or a prof
[18/03/23, 2:41:44 PM] Himir Desai: Yeah from there or any one would work not necessarily from bits
[18/03/23, 2:41:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: from the Bits group i don’t think we need a 3rd, if we take one let’s take her
[18/03/23, 2:42:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hmm
[18/03/23, 2:42:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you have anyone in mind bro?
[18/03/23, 2:42:12 PM] Himir Desai: Nope
[18/03/23, 2:42:25 PM] Ritvick Pandey: see let’s plan what to do in evening
[18/03/23, 2:42:31 PM] Himir Desai: Okay
[18/03/23, 2:42:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if our plan includes the necessity of a processor
[18/03/23, 2:42:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: then we’ll call her
[18/03/23, 2:42:42 PM] Himir Desai: Okay done
[18/03/23, 2:42:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if not we’ll just go ahead by ourselves
[18/03/23, 2:42:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: peace
[18/03/23, 2:43:04 PM] Himir Desai: Okay then bye
[18/03/23, 7:08:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: HELLO
[18/03/23, 7:08:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m excited
[18/03/23, 7:08:25 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you look like a kaam ka banda
[18/03/23, 7:08:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ve found 2/3 ppl from the BITS group like this i’m sure it’ll help for college scene
[18/03/23, 7:09:47 PM] Himir Desai: (I assume this is what you sent them)
[18/03/23, 7:10:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yup
[18/03/23, 7:10:21 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 2 so far
[18/03/23, 7:10:41 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you and the junior academy guy
[18/03/23, 7:10:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know about the others
[18/03/23, 7:11:16 PM] Himir Desai: Nomadic? (Adarsh)
[18/03/23, 7:11:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yessir
[18/03/23, 7:11:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i like him, our hobbies match a lot too
[18/03/23, 7:14:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: also
[18/03/23, 7:14:16 PM] Himir Desai: Yeah but he is a samaj ka bhala wada aadmi if you ask him he will tell everybody so choose your words appropriately also he has a startup so I don’t know if he will be willing to give time to this. Considering all this I have become a good friend of him from a few days so I can also talk to him
[18/03/23, 7:14:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: a prof responded to the emails i was sending to unis here
[18/03/23, 7:14:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: exactly
[18/03/23, 7:14:41 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i haven’t talked to him about the research thing bro
[18/03/23, 7:14:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i meant this in general
[18/03/23, 7:15:00 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i spoke to him last week regarding programs and ECs and now he is a good friend
[18/03/23, 7:15:40 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he told to educate ourselves first and think of research during undergrad
[18/03/23, 7:15:53 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so not very helpful
[18/03/23, 7:16:15 PM] Himir Desai: Ohh that will be difficult to respond to
[18/03/23, 7:16:34 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he said it very politely, not in such a rude manner
[18/03/23, 7:16:53 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he said first we need to have atleast undergrad level knowledge and then think of all this
[18/03/23, 7:17:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i can’t say we only wanna do this for college applications
[18/03/23, 7:17:14 PM] Himir Desai: Like what did you ask him?
[18/03/23, 7:17:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: his mail was sent to me by my high school teacher
[18/03/23, 7:17:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: she told he’ll help us out
[18/03/23, 7:17:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so i asked for guidance, how to get started etc
[18/03/23, 7:17:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he replied saying focus on getting into college and finish it
[18/03/23, 7:18:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: then do research
[18/03/23, 7:18:16 PM] Himir Desai: I will talk to my mom and dad they might know someone from MSU. My parents are it’s alumni
[18/03/23, 7:18:30 PM] Himir Desai: That’s what we are doing
[18/03/23, 7:18:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: how do you suggest we get started with the whole research thing?
[18/03/23, 7:18:40 PM] Ritvick Pandey: do you have any plan other than
[18/03/23, 7:18:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: contacting professors
[18/03/23, 7:19:12 PM] Himir Desai: We just need guidance then we can start independently
[18/03/23, 7:19:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yeah
[18/03/23, 7:19:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the problem is no prof will guide us cause we can’t help them in any way
[18/03/23, 7:19:28 PM] Himir Desai: And we can get guidance from those who have done such a thing before
[18/03/23, 7:19:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: do you wanna add her?
[18/03/23, 7:19:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we’d get some guidance atleast
[18/03/23, 7:20:13 PM] Himir Desai: She’s in?
[18/03/23, 7:20:16 PM] Himir Desai: Grade?
[18/03/23, 7:20:21 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i have no clue
[18/03/23, 7:20:29 PM] Himir Desai: Wait let me check in that poll
[18/03/23, 7:20:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we need someone as serious, also someone who needs it. 11th and 12th graders seem perfect
[18/03/23, 7:20:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’d prefer if she was in 12th
[18/03/23, 7:20:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so she works towards the deadline we have too
[18/03/23, 7:21:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: check check
[18/03/23, 7:21:06 PM] Himir Desai: Yeah exactly
[18/03/23, 7:22:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: fucks sake
[18/03/23, 7:22:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: she’s in 9th bro
‎[18/03/23, 7:22:32 PM] Himir Desai: ‎image omitted
[18/03/23, 7:22:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i just saw
[18/03/23, 7:22:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what do you think?
[18/03/23, 7:23:00 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we could still add her
[18/03/23, 7:23:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: after the guidance by the prof
[18/03/23, 7:23:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we could slowly get into our own project
[18/03/23, 7:23:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: sounds bitchy but i mean
[18/03/23, 7:23:55 PM] Himir Desai: From this the 12th wala cannot be chosen uska to application would be over and admission bhi ho Gaya hoga if he wants to go abroad
[18/03/23, 7:24:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: plus
[18/03/23, 7:24:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he started math prep one day before his board exam
[18/03/23, 7:24:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so i highly doubt he’d be interested anyway
[18/03/23, 7:24:25 PM] Himir Desai: Tru
[18/03/23, 7:24:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: one guy said he had research experience no? in the group
[18/03/23, 7:24:46 PM] Himir Desai: Ohh ha let’s check
[18/03/23, 7:25:14 PM] Ritvick Pandey: Siddharth
[18/03/23, 7:25:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: again class 9
[18/03/23, 7:26:14 PM] Himir Desai: Yeah just saw that
[18/03/23, 7:26:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m staring to doubt the research exp
[18/03/23, 7:26:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what do you wanna do?
[18/03/23, 7:26:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: one thing we can do is- ask how to start in the group and see the answers
[18/03/23, 7:27:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: worst case we pick up the professor waali
[18/03/23, 7:27:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and go on from there
[18/03/23, 7:27:12 PM] Himir Desai: I have applied for polygence and usme I will get scholarship because <90000 dollar is req and mine is approx 30000 on paper
[18/03/23, 7:27:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i wanted to apply bro but it’s too exp
[18/03/23, 7:27:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: plus even after scholarship it’ll still be a lakh no?
[18/03/23, 7:27:39 PM] Himir Desai: but it will take time to get an answer from there
[18/03/23, 7:27:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s not 100%
[18/03/23, 7:27:53 PM] Himir Desai: I am waiting for that only
[18/03/23, 7:28:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i had checked online
[18/03/23, 7:28:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: scholarship provided was not that much
[18/03/23, 7:28:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: which is why i didn’t bother
[18/03/23, 7:28:15 PM] Himir Desai: But they will get the research published guaranteed
[18/03/23, 7:28:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: there is one research program
[18/03/23, 7:28:21 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 100 usd
[18/03/23, 7:28:26 PM] Himir Desai: Which?
[18/03/23, 7:28:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but it starts in august
[18/03/23, 7:28:36 PM] Ritvick Pandey: my teacher said she’ll share shortly
[18/03/23, 7:28:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s an indian program only
[18/03/23, 7:28:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so like 7k rs
[18/03/23, 7:28:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but aug is too late
[18/03/23, 7:28:53 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we need to start asap
[18/03/23, 7:28:59 PM] Himir Desai: In august it will be very late school mai exams bhi hogi
[18/03/23, 7:29:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan bro
[18/03/23, 7:29:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: kya kare?
[18/03/23, 7:29:22 PM] Himir Desai: Mai dundhta hu kuchh
[18/03/23, 7:29:25 PM] Ritvick Pandey: .
[18/03/23, 7:29:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: surely people’s answers will include what they can provide
[18/03/23, 7:29:41 PM] Himir Desai: Yeah that we can do
[18/03/23, 7:29:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’ll help us choose a partner also
[18/03/23, 7:29:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: cool i’ll send message rn
[18/03/23, 7:30:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you also add a supporting one
[18/03/23, 7:30:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: then i’ll look online
[18/03/23, 7:30:11 PM] Himir Desai: Done
[18/03/23, 7:30:13 PM] Himir Desai: Me too
[18/03/23, 7:32:37 PM] Himir Desai: I was going to pay $5040 for Cornell precollege which I got admitted to but then I didn’t because the course wasn’t aligned with my goal
[18/03/23, 7:32:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: We first need a thesis statement
[18/03/23, 7:32:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: this is just a
[18/03/23, 7:32:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: how to get started on research google answer
[18/03/23, 7:33:14 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i see
[18/03/23, 7:33:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i was joining this program
[18/03/23, 7:33:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: here in bangalore itself
[18/03/23, 7:33:26 PM] Ritvick Pandey: for 4lakh
[18/03/23, 7:33:31 PM] Ritvick Pandey: they promised published research papers
[18/03/23, 7:33:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but for some reason i don’t trust indians in such matters
[18/03/23, 7:36:01 PM] Himir Desai: What will the subject of our research?
[18/03/23, 7:36:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what do you wanna do when you’re older?
[18/03/23, 7:36:27 PM] Himir Desai: AI
[18/03/23, 7:36:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we are set on physics right?
[18/03/23, 7:36:35 PM] Himir Desai: You?
[18/03/23, 7:36:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: research on AI would be too complex for now
[18/03/23, 7:37:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: mechanical engineering, AI, entrepreneur
[18/03/23, 7:37:14 PM] Himir Desai: Yeah it will be but physics will be even more because it is an explored field AI is unexplored
[18/03/23, 7:37:21 PM] Himir Desai: And so are many others
[18/03/23, 7:37:30 PM] Himir Desai: I am not saying to do research on AI
[18/03/23, 7:37:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yesyes I was just aise hi asking
[18/03/23, 7:37:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: anyway
[18/03/23, 7:37:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in physics
[18/03/23, 7:37:51 PM] Ritvick Pandey: theoretical physics
[18/03/23, 7:37:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: is a hot topic for research
[18/03/23, 7:38:02 PM] Ritvick Pandey: now under that we can choose something
[18/03/23, 7:38:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: based on professors we find
[18/03/23, 7:38:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I found a prof doing research on loop quantum gravity
[18/03/23, 7:38:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and hes from a pretty chotta college
[18/03/23, 7:39:00 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so hed let us help
[18/03/23, 7:39:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but that topic will require toooo much laerning
[18/03/23, 7:39:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: lets see what others are saying in the GC
[18/03/23, 7:39:19 PM] Himir Desai: Exactly
[18/03/23, 7:39:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I say, we let sara contact a professor first
[18/03/23, 7:39:44 PM] Himir Desai: In college what major you are expecting
[18/03/23, 7:40:25 PM] Ritvick Pandey: Mechanical engineering
[18/03/23, 7:40:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i was inclined towards CS in 9th-10th
[18/03/23, 7:40:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: now its mechanical
[18/03/23, 7:40:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you?
[18/03/23, 7:41:40 PM] Himir Desai: CS. Mechanical is too hard for me
[18/03/23, 7:42:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: opposite for me bhai
[18/03/23, 7:42:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: programming is not for me
[18/03/23, 7:42:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i was going to learn in 10th but ive been delaying it since
[18/03/23, 7:43:06 PM] Himir Desai: then we can do a collaboration type of thing you can do the pysical part i will make simulationd or models or something
[18/03/23, 7:43:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: exactly
[18/03/23, 7:44:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what my plan was, ill learn cs simultaneously while/after my mechanical engineering
[18/03/23, 7:44:14 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but i cant take cs and then do mechanical later on
[18/03/23, 7:44:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: this is perfect
[18/03/23, 7:44:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: sun
[18/03/23, 7:44:26 PM] Ritvick Pandey: sara asked her dad
[18/03/23, 7:44:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: check gc
[18/03/23, 7:44:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: lets not put all hope into it though
[18/03/23, 7:44:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ill still look for other ways, a program would be best bro
‎[18/03/23, 7:45:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[18/03/23, 7:45:32 PM] Ritvick Pandey: do you want to make a gc, sara, you and I
[18/03/23, 7:45:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but problem is she might be friends with others from the bits gc
[18/03/23, 7:47:00 PM] Himir Desai: see all of us
[18/03/23, 7:48:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan?
[18/03/23, 7:48:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yaar i shouldn't have asked in the GC
[18/03/23, 7:49:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: We need to consider how much there is to research about
[18/03/23, 7:49:15 PM] Himir Desai: yeah and if its indian good uni then even better
[18/03/23, 7:49:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: like what the fuck does that even mean
[18/03/23, 7:50:30 PM] Himir Desai: like they have a lot of time they are in 9th they can do extensive research
[18/03/23, 7:53:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: well let them figure out plans
[18/03/23, 7:53:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if one is good
[18/03/23, 7:53:46 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you and I can use it and do our own project for college apps
[18/03/23, 7:54:46 PM] Himir Desai: yeah and i am in Allen Global studies division i will ask my sir to connect me with alumni who has done similar stuff
[18/03/23, 7:54:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ek broad topic Pehle decide karlete hain
[18/03/23, 7:55:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so when were researching on how to research
[18/03/23, 7:55:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: itll be easier
[18/03/23, 7:55:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: like theoretical physics
[18/03/23, 7:55:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: works for you?
[18/03/23, 7:55:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: theoretical physics cause most unis offer research programs in theoretical physics only as far as ive found
[18/03/23, 7:55:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so just in case we find one later on, we could use it to add on to our paper
[18/03/23, 7:56:02 PM] Ritvick Pandey: badhiyaa
[18/03/23, 7:56:29 PM] Himir Desai: If we ask a student currently in college (from india) who has done research in school then we can get guidance from him and he/she will guide us knowing the truth of why we want to research
[18/03/23, 7:56:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i did just that
[18/03/23, 7:56:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i saw this video of this guy getting accepted
[18/03/23, 7:56:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: into MIT

[20/03/23, 12:30:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: see
[20/03/23, 12:30:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I asked him
[20/03/23, 12:30:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: this
[20/03/23, 12:30:34 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ritvick, and I am a high school student who is deeply interested in physics. My friend and I were discussing research opportunities and recently learned about your research in astrophysics and the theory of relativity, and we found it very fascinating.

I am writing to you because we would love to learn more about these topics and get involved in research. However, we are not very knowledgeable about them at the moment, and we don't know where to start. I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how we can get started in learning about these topics and how we can eventually get involved in research.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or resources you can provide, and I promise to put in the effort and dedication needed to learn and grow in this field. Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear back from you soon.

Sincerely,
Ritvick Pandey
[20/03/23, 12:30:40 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he responded saying

[20/03/23, 12:32:33 PM] Himir Desai: You continue the conversation with him till then I am waiting for that caltech guy
[20/03/23, 12:32:35 PM] Himir Desai: WHAT
[20/03/23, 12:32:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i sent it at 12 he responded at 1204
[20/03/23, 12:32:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: TEAH
[20/03/23, 12:32:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i checked mail rn and i saw his reply n i was like etc
[20/03/23, 12:32:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: wtf*
[20/03/23, 12:33:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i feel bad for responding after 20 mins

[20/03/23, 12:33:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: peace
[20/03/23, 12:33:24 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we’ll look for more professors in nearby unis
[20/03/23, 12:33:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: turns out they’re free
[20/03/23, 12:33:33 PM] Himir Desai: He must be desperate for some help and so are we
[20/03/23, 12:34:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: fucks sake
[20/03/23, 12:34:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: While I would be happy to give you a project, I worry that your XII standard being a crucial stage in your life, might get affected if you devote too much time to other things - can you please arrange so that your parents can write to me saying that it is fine for you to undertake a project?  Your studies and academics are an important part of your activities and they affect a lot on what you do next. I would like to have the feedback from them that you are doing fine and that they are okay with you working on a project (while your classmates might be slogging it out for IITs).
[20/03/23, 12:34:21 PM] Himir Desai: There is only one good uni in Vadodara so I will be contacting some professors there now
[20/03/23, 12:35:29 PM] Himir Desai: How much time does he expect us to give
[20/03/23, 12:35:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: idk bro
[20/03/23, 12:35:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what should I respond saying

[20/03/23, 7:14:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the Caltech guy responded??
‎[20/03/23, 7:14:43 PM] Himir Desai: in.gov.cbse-SSCER-111298112022.pdf • ‎1 page ‎document omitted
[20/03/23, 7:14:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it should be morning where he is now
[20/03/23, 7:14:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: peace
[20/03/23, 7:14:58 PM] Himir Desai: Not yet
[20/03/23, 11:53:14 PM] Himir Desai: Caltech wala “you would want to read on your own and try to contact professors close to you to look for projects. I think it would be very tough to do research on your own in any field, with a lot more collaboration needed”
[21/03/23, 12:04:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ah
[21/03/23, 12:04:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: fuck, I was hoping the Caltech wala could be of a lot more help
[21/03/23, 12:04:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: well keep contacting profs then
[21/03/23, 12:05:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or we could just wait for the cornell wali ka program
[21/03/23, 12:07:00 AM] Himir Desai: Actually I got to know that here MSU ke Computer Science Department Head is the parent of my brother’s room mate I think or atleast they are in same college and I have met him like 2-3 times on railway station because both my brother and all bits students of Vadodara come and go together
[21/03/23, 12:07:28 AM] Himir Desai: So my mom dad have become atleast friends with that professor
[21/03/23, 12:07:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: oh?!?
[21/03/23, 12:07:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but, what could we do research in in CSE?
[21/03/23, 12:09:06 AM] Himir Desai: What we can do is ask him for some projects that’s what the Caltech guy said to look for projects or like I could be real in front of him because he is a friend of my parent first and professor second
[21/03/23, 12:09:16 AM] Himir Desai: He can definitely help us
[21/03/23, 12:09:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: BADHIYA bro
[21/03/23, 12:09:46 AM] Himir Desai: if you are applying this fall, I do not think you should be starting a new project. I would rather spend time on past projects, and your actual applications
[21/03/23, 12:09:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I was thinking that we can contact BITS goa ka physics faculty before going there
[21/03/23, 12:09:53 AM] Himir Desai: Caltech wala
[21/03/23, 12:09:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and then when were there we could meet them irl
[21/03/23, 12:10:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hmm
[21/03/23, 12:10:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: what do you think?
[21/03/23, 12:10:34 AM] Himir Desai: I think that sounds good
[21/03/23, 12:10:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: we have 6-8 months for application deadline bro I think we have some time atleast
[21/03/23, 12:10:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no I meant what do u think about what Caltech wala said
[21/03/23, 12:10:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ok great

[21/03/23, 12:41:37 AM] Himir Desai: And then I don’t know I lured my principal into the idea
[21/03/23, 12:42:56 AM] Himir Desai: Actually I messed up here the club name earlier was going to be the Codehead’s club but then our principal madam said to change it then I changed it to The Geek Guild everywhere but u forgot to change it below my sign on the last page
[21/03/23, 12:46:36 AM] Himir Desai: I*
[21/03/23, 12:49:10 AM] Himir Desai: One more thing if you want to tackle your coordinator if she at all wants to coordinate you are better of speaking authoritatively rather then using too many please in your request
[21/03/23, 12:50:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I was thinking, I just won a physics tournament for my school 2 weeks ago and were asked to submit all winnings from school name to our admins office
[21/03/23, 12:50:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so ill go there and ask if I can talk to the principal for 2 minutes
[21/03/23, 12:50:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: they cant refuse
[21/03/23, 12:50:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: thanks a lot fr bro I appreciate u actually helping
[21/03/23, 12:50:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: lets see ill think of something

[21/03/23, 12:52:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: theyre local city tournaments
[21/03/23, 12:52:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: inter school
[21/03/23, 12:52:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i would've put if we were us citizens
[21/03/23, 12:52:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but were international applicants, so we have to be much better than the normal
[21/03/23, 12:53:13 AM] Himir Desai: Like I if I had to ask I would say: Respected Ma’am this is a request to your regarding the conversation we had earlier regarding the formation of clubs where you denied me to do any such activity in the school. I would you to reconsider this request keeping any bias you had earlier. The formation of clubs will help other students getting out of their regular curriculum and will develop lots of soft skills in them….. and ese continue but I like sounding a little threatening tbh
[21/03/23, 12:53:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO
[21/03/23, 12:53:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: u sound like youll kill her kids if she says no
[21/03/23, 12:54:38 AM] Himir Desai: I like that that but there is no such evidence and this is extremely formal but it can be better if given more time
[21/03/23, 12:57:26 AM] Himir Desai: Respected Ma’am,
I, Himir Desai, am writing this email in reference to the verbal conversation I had with Vandana Ma’am regarding the formation of school clubs. I and my friend, Aryan Sharma, of class XI-D want to organise 2 clubs: one for math and the other for computer science (IP). The purpose of the formation of these clubs is to encourage curious minds and to expand their knowledge of respective fields.

The clubs would work via WhatsApp groups and resources will be shared to the members on it. Club meetings will be held as per requirement and quizzes and competitions will also be organized for the members. Any student from any grade can join the club if they are interested in that subject. The recruitment of members with the handled by us through a google form. This is the start of clubs at Green Valley High School ,and after we are gone the clubs shall continue with newly elected presidents and new members.

We would be thankful if the school permits the formation of such clubs and recognises them as a part of school rather than individual student groups. We would also be grateful if the teachers be a part of the group and help us if there arises any problem (but for the most part, being a student organisation, it will be managed by the members). After getting the permission to create these clubs we will start working on the activities and will share details about each club through subsequent emails. Also, Manisha Ma’am (Allen) has granted us permission to create these clubs if the school allows to do so.

Thanking You,
Yours Sincerely
Himir Desai (Grade XI-D)

If you have any ongoing research projects or know of any upcoming opportunities for students to get involved in research, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know. I am willing to volunteer my time and put in the effort required to contribute meaningfully to any project that aligns with my interests.

Thank you for taking the time to read my message. I would be happy to provide any additional information or answer any questions you may have.

Sincerely,
[Insert your name]

We got to learn about the concept of Moat: Something which protects the company from its competitors. Going ahead we had a marvellous session by Mr. Rao, the vice chancellor of BITS University, which made us delve into the world of nanotech. In the Creative thinking session we learned: “creation is an iterative process rather than a linear process”. The final movie on coal capped the day with an informative documentary of problems faced by the people.

[16/04/23, 11:40:39 AM] Himir Desai: AGSD ke sir
[16/04/23, 11:40:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: The MAT is designed to be approachable for all students, including those without Further Mathematics A-level or equivalent. It aims to test the depth of mathematical understanding of a student rather than a breadth of knowledge. The mathematical knowledge and techniques required to do the questions are taken from a syllabus roughly corresponding to AS-level Maths, with a few extra topics from A-level Maths. If you're unsure what this covers, you can find the full MAT syllabus on the practice materials tab on this page.
[16/04/23, 11:40:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: AS level
[16/04/23, 11:40:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: what is AS level

[19/04/23, 11:55:35 PM] Himir Desai: To experience fun and happiness of different kinds . Friends Relations Wife Children Grandchildren Retirement
[19/04/23, 11:56:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i see
[19/04/23, 11:56:07 PM] Himir Desai: I have just cleared level 1
[19/04/23, 11:56:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: of?
[19/04/23, 11:56:21 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that is the closest i’ve come to as well
[19/04/23, 11:56:26 PM] Ritvick Pandey: whenever i try to think of something
[19/04/23, 11:56:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: everything else seems pretty.. well pointless
[19/04/23, 11:56:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: still i’m not satisfied
[19/04/23, 11:56:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: anyway thanks
[19/04/23, 11:57:46 PM] Himir Desai: 1) Friends 
2) Relationship
3) Wife
4) Children
5) Grandchildren 
6) Retirement
[19/04/23, 11:57:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: oh so level 1 in this
[19/04/23, 11:58:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i thought some program
[19/04/23, 11:58:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i was reading this book na
[19/04/23, 11:58:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and in the book the author says
[19/04/23, 11:58:53 PM] Himir Desai: What I said was the motive of my life the purpose I still don’t know. And as of now I would say ki purpose is finding purpose
[19/04/23, 11:59:29 PM] Ritvick Pandey: most of the people take up money, success, or like you said to experience fun in various relationdhips as a goal
[19/04/23, 11:59:53 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but that is just to cope with the fact that there’s no actual purpose
[20/04/23, 12:00:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: later on he says we try to find ways to become happy and not just try to be happy
[20/04/23, 12:00:23 AM] Himir Desai: There is no purpose. Think of a world without the earth nothing would change
[20/04/23, 12:00:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this sentence contradicts this
[20/04/23, 12:00:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: because having good relationships
[20/04/23, 12:00:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: is a reason to be happy
[20/04/23, 12:00:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so overall i’d say it’s a shit book
[20/04/23, 12:00:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i thought i’d ask someone
[20/04/23, 12:01:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: exactly
[20/04/23, 12:01:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: doesn’t that piss you off
[20/04/23, 12:01:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ve been trying since a while bro probably like 6th grade
[20/04/23, 12:01:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: nothing movie like has struck me so far
[20/04/23, 12:01:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and i doubt anything will
[20/04/23, 12:02:13 AM] Himir Desai: What is happiness a feeling? That’s it
[20/04/23, 12:02:20 AM] Himir Desai: So even that is pointless
[20/04/23, 12:02:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: exactly
[20/04/23, 12:02:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: isn’t that
[20/04/23, 12:02:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: irritsting
[20/04/23, 12:02:36 AM] Himir Desai: In 6th I was an NPC tbh
[20/04/23, 12:03:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that your entire consciousness is a spark of some random particles
[20/04/23, 12:03:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: LMAO why do i understand that
[20/04/23, 12:03:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: me too until 5th
[20/04/23, 12:03:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 6th is when i’d say i like took control from auto drive
[20/04/23, 12:03:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: anyway
[20/04/23, 12:03:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then why do anything
[20/04/23, 12:04:00 AM] Himir Desai: Ha it is. The only one thing that brings me happiness as of now and that too very short and that is the dream of some good small house with a nice girl
[20/04/23, 12:04:19 AM] Himir Desai: In a village
[20/04/23, 12:04:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this pissed me off a lot toll 8th then i just said to myself might as well make a lot of money to have a little fun in a meanfinelss life
‎[20/04/23, 12:04:38 AM] Himir Desai: ‎image omitted
[20/04/23, 12:04:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i’m thinking even that will become pointless
[20/04/23, 12:04:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: after a while
[20/04/23, 12:04:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: dekh but
[20/04/23, 12:04:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that will just fuck your condition even more na
[20/04/23, 12:05:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: because one day she’ll die
[20/04/23, 12:05:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then you’ll be much worse off
[20/04/23, 12:05:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: than before
[20/04/23, 12:05:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: now you’re stuck in a keanginless existence
[20/04/23, 12:05:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and you’re sad
[20/04/23, 12:05:27 AM] Himir Desai: (Even masturbating is boring sometimes)
[20/04/23, 12:05:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i think only being totally obsessed with a girl is something that would remove this constant itch of purposelessness
[20/04/23, 12:05:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but even that would fade after sometime don’t u think
[20/04/23, 12:06:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i mean that we’ve only seen in movies
[20/04/23, 12:06:01 AM] Himir Desai: Nahi that’s not the thing she will not die because this will never happen in the first place
[20/04/23, 12:06:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: not even one example irl
[20/04/23, 12:06:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bhai😭

[20/04/23, 12:07:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but yes
[20/04/23, 12:07:47 AM] Himir Desai: Because if I don’t then I will have to answer to many people (parents friends) that I find even worse
[20/04/23, 12:08:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bro but even that doesn’t matter after a point na

[20/04/23, 12:10:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: such short moments of happiness make me ignore the meaninglessness
[20/04/23, 12:10:20 AM] Himir Desai: Pop?

[20/04/23, 12:13:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i just wanted to know
[20/04/23, 12:13:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if others feel the same
[20/04/23, 12:13:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then i realised
[20/04/23, 12:13:13 AM] Himir Desai: I have asked just 3-4 times in my life
[20/04/23, 12:13:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: most are
[20/04/23, 12:13:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: NPCs
[20/04/23, 12:13:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that don’t actually think that deep
[20/04/23, 12:13:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i thought i’ll ask off
[20/04/23, 12:13:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hain
[20/04/23, 12:13:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i want waisa connection with my mum
[20/04/23, 12:13:40 AM] Himir Desai: Most are blinded by JEE and IITs
[20/04/23, 12:13:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i don’t trust anyone with such decisions
[20/04/23, 12:13:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i usually sit and think myself
[20/04/23, 12:14:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan but i wish i was like that too
[20/04/23, 12:14:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that is so badhiya na
[20/04/23, 12:14:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: you’d be happy with a college
[20/04/23, 12:14:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then happy with a job
[20/04/23, 12:14:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then die off happily
[20/04/23, 12:14:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: without ever thinking so much
[20/04/23, 12:14:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: they’re living the same life except they’re constantly happy
[20/04/23, 12:14:44 AM] Himir Desai: I wished that till last year ki why I matured earlier because I started to think of life from 9th onwards while other were busy with their cricket ball
[20/04/23, 12:15:07 AM] Himir Desai: But then now I think ki it’s a non sense race they are running in
[20/04/23, 12:15:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this has been me since class 6-7
[20/04/23, 12:15:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then i saw that it is stupid after entering class X
[20/04/23, 12:15:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yes exactly
[20/04/23, 12:15:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but still
[20/04/23, 12:15:32 AM] Himir Desai: Only top 1000 ranks have such privileges
[20/04/23, 12:15:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: .
[20/04/23, 12:15:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bhai people die for VITs
[20/04/23, 12:15:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: different people hage different goals
[20/04/23, 12:15:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: different “IITs”
[20/04/23, 12:16:02 AM] Himir Desai: VIT mai mere bhai ka ek dost hai he barely passes 12th boards
[20/04/23, 12:16:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: kuch log ke liye just Btech is enough
[20/04/23, 12:16:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m saying isn’t that great
[20/04/23, 12:16:18 AM] Himir Desai: Passed*
[20/04/23, 12:16:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: because they live happily
[20/04/23, 12:16:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: why are only some of us
[20/04/23, 12:16:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: fucked
[20/04/23, 12:16:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: same humare school ke saare failures went there
[20/04/23, 12:16:53 AM] Himir Desai: I always wanted to be that class ka student who passed due to teachers grace and still he was so happy and carefree
[20/04/23, 12:17:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i had a similar discussion about how others are NPCs and live happily with my sir
[20/04/23, 12:17:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: when i was a kid na
[20/04/23, 12:17:56 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for a long period i was happy
[20/04/23, 12:18:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that i’m not like other dumbfucks
[20/04/23, 12:18:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and can actually think for myself
[20/04/23, 12:18:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but now i’m thinking what’s the point anyway might as well couldve been happy
[20/04/23, 12:18:37 AM] Himir Desai: But then I see one of my friend he is not one of them but he is still 75% wala so it’s low. He to the world appears so happy and full of life but as I am one of his friend I know he is hollow from inside. It isn’t what it looks like
[20/04/23, 12:19:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: whay the fucj are you speaking about me cause i told i got that much in chem
[20/04/23, 12:19:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 🤣🤣🤣
[20/04/23, 12:19:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i got 98 in phy mother fucjer fuck you
[20/04/23, 12:19:46 AM] Himir Desai: Majority of people in my class and school think I don’t need to worry for anything. I will get a good rank and college and good job it’s so easy for you. But that’s what I show them it’s not what I truly gave
[20/04/23, 12:19:48 AM] Himir Desai: Face*
[20/04/23, 12:20:07 AM] Himir Desai: Nahi it’s saumya one of my childhood friend from play school
[20/04/23, 12:20:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: isn’t it tho
[20/04/23, 12:20:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: compared to ptjers

[20/04/23, 12:20:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i have no problem
[20/04/23, 12:20:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: getting a good college
[20/04/23, 12:20:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: people suicide for IITs
[20/04/23, 12:20:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: even if i don’t study much i can definitely get 3-4k rank and go to IIT kharagpur
[20/04/23, 12:20:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m sure u can too
[20/04/23, 12:20:45 AM] Himir Desai: But that’s not what brings me happiness. Good college for them is not good for me
[20/04/23, 12:20:56 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan again
[20/04/23, 12:20:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: they’re NPCs

[20/04/23, 12:21:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: chal anyway goodnight
[20/04/23, 12:22:17 AM] Himir Desai: In my school or class I would be the most carefree person hands down. I fucking don’t do any homework and I confidently say teachers that I haven’t
[20/04/23, 12:23:09 AM] Himir Desai: but that’s because I am lazy but I give excuse to myself ki I don’t have time
[20/04/23, 12:24:11 AM] Himir Desai: I want to change that that’s why I have started to bring drastic changes to my lifestyle now. Insta to I had deleted yesterday and now I intend to build a good sleep cycle
[20/04/23, 12:25:26 AM] Himir Desai: Then I will organise everything to get sone free time just for myself listening to songs being with friends for fun and not studies going to concerts (in May there are 30 consecutive concerts it’s called taste of Vadodara)
[20/04/23, 12:25:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: wait i’ll be right back
[20/04/23, 12:25:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my mom is screaming
[20/04/23, 12:25:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i promised her i’ll sleep early and wake up at 6
[20/04/23, 12:26:00 AM] Himir Desai: My mom sleeps at 10 and she has no idea what I do after that
[20/04/23, 12:29:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: same
[20/04/23, 12:29:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i used to give excuse of this only
[20/04/23, 12:29:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that oh nothing has meaning anyway
[20/04/23, 12:29:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and let all that slide
[20/04/23, 12:29:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it never bit in my back cause i still scored good and all
[20/04/23, 12:29:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i just let it be like that
[20/04/23, 12:30:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: BRO i had this want of change
[20/04/23, 12:30:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: right after BITS
[20/04/23, 12:30:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but now it’s gone again

[20/04/23, 12:31:15 AM] Himir Desai: But for me I have told to n number of people about this change and now I can’t step back and get taunts from them that’s why I told that so that I cannot not do it
[20/04/23, 12:31:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yaar wtf
[20/04/23, 12:31:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i tried this same exact thing but now i just feel like a besharam

[20/04/23, 12:32:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ll tell someone else so the taunts are effective’s
[20/04/23, 12:32:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: effective*

[20/04/23, 12:32:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this stupid question
[20/04/23, 12:32:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: somehow comes
[20/04/23, 12:33:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: back into my mind
[20/04/23, 12:33:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and kills the feeling

[20/04/23, 12:34:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or else i will stay curious
[20/04/23, 12:34:36 AM] Himir Desai: Ok wait
[20/04/23, 12:37:08 AM] Himir Desai: Ha to as I said I have been through this and at that time just because of this I slept at 10pm woke up at 2pm (to minimise thinking) and sat in a room alone watching YouTube to entertain me missing all the classes and just went outside the room for meals. This was when I realised ki India mai there is no hope for a life like how I am living right now and the thought of living a worse life scared the hell out of me
[20/04/23, 12:37:24 AM] Himir Desai: And tab I decided I am not staying in India still I was depressed af
[20/04/23, 12:38:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bro you won’t believe it cause i’ve been saying same same since tjen but same exact thing happened, but then this bubble burst as well when i went to Dubai and everything still sucked
[20/04/23, 12:38:50 AM] Himir Desai: How I fixed that feeling even I don’t know mostly spending more time with friends
[20/04/23, 12:39:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this happened with me twice
[20/04/23, 12:39:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: once in 11th last year and once in 6th
[20/04/23, 12:39:18 AM] Himir Desai: The happiest time in my life was in Goa at YEB tbh
[20/04/23, 12:39:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i stopped going out of my room completely and just sat in fucking irritation
[20/04/23, 12:39:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i was tooo depressed
[20/04/23, 12:39:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i didn’t expect it at all but again same
[20/04/23, 12:39:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know if it was because it was right after my 11th
[20/04/23, 12:40:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or if i like being busy all the time
[20/04/23, 12:40:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but YEB was definitely the happiest i’ve been
[20/04/23, 12:40:28 AM] Himir Desai: I have not had any bubble burst and so I still find peace in the thought of going abroad but soon I will face the reality over there
[20/04/23, 12:40:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: nahi actually you know what
[20/04/23, 12:40:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i can’t say
[20/04/23, 12:40:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s a total bubble burst
[20/04/23, 12:40:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the average feeling
[20/04/23, 12:40:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: is MICH BETTER AABROAD
[20/04/23, 12:41:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: because everything is just so much better to look at
[20/04/23, 12:41:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but that is also only for a week or maybe a month
[20/04/23, 12:41:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then you’ll get used to it and then bubble burst
[20/04/23, 12:41:21 AM] Himir Desai: Exactly
[20/04/23, 12:41:41 AM] Himir Desai: But US mai visa will be a hanging sword over our heads
[20/04/23, 12:42:11 AM] Himir Desai: H1B milega phir green card milega aur green card apply kara to we are basically trapped in US
[20/04/23, 12:42:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: already bichara futta hua hai bubble😭😭 aur nahi faadte hain
[20/04/23, 12:42:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: let’s have one comfort thought until it too goes next year
[20/04/23, 12:42:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ok anyways, aakhri wala goodnight

[20/04/23, 11:42:33 AM] Himir Desai: Ha to back to point of life ke thoughts. Mera dusra thought was ki i have to earn enough so that i can be one of the early mars settlers. but these all childish thoughts main wala i had thought and now i forgot to i will have to rethink
[20/04/23, 11:53:14 AM] Himir Desai: main thought ye tha ki what i want to be is a wanderer. Like every few months i would like to explore new places and what is the point of it you ask. There is no point I remembered ki i was known for doing silly things and i loved it in the future i also want to do totally pointless things like making a boat in my backyard in free time, gifting my mom a single diamong solitare ring because i promised to her as a joke in 6-7th. but ye sab ke liye you need money and so i will go to foreign desh. for a software engineer now more than any other fields remote jobs are available and they pay even more because company doesn't need to spend on electricity, transport, food, etc. To there are just 2 things i will need in the future time and money and untill i do not get them i have a reason to live i wont think what will i do after getting them thats left for then. Ha and do not judge the english i just types as thoughts came in my head

[20/04/23, 12:27:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i havent seen stats syllabus
[20/04/23, 12:27:43 PM] Himir Desai: The thing is during boards everything was certain I wrote the entire week ka time table because nothing unexpected could come during that time
[20/04/23, 12:28:05 PM] Himir Desai: I will give mechanics just 1-2 hours before the test date not more than that
[20/04/23, 12:28:25 PM] Himir Desai: Ha that is a pain in the butt usme there are so many terminology
[20/04/23, 12:28:42 PM] Himir Desai: And formula sheet mai many important formulae are not given

[20/04/23, 12:39:53 PM] Himir Desai: Rate to kinetics mai
[20/04/23, 12:40:14 PM] Himir Desai: Thought rate constant is the equilibrium constant of rate determining step
[20/04/23, 12:40:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: himir😁😁😁😁😁 chemistry ki baat chodd de😁😁😁😁😁

[21/04/23, 12:26:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: SET
[21/04/23, 12:26:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: set*
[21/04/23, 4:55:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: himir
[21/04/23, 5:02:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 1. *Brooklyn 99* - Funny show you can watch on and off, not serious at all with like very little romance, has 8 seasons, and is one of the best shows of this generation (2010ish)

2. *Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* - Funny show again, considered a classic, one of the best of all times. This is what launched Will Smith and made him what he is. Not for all however and you may not like it, has 6 seasons.

3. *Lucifer* - If you want a short show fantasy romcom (Romantic Comedy = romcom ) type show, then this is it. A devil ( god ka beta devil ) and a detective fall in love. Good show to waste time, again you may not like it. 6 seasons.

4. *The Good Place* - Great show! again its mostly comedy, but it does make you think a lot at certain points, (tere philosopher side ke liye accha hai), most INTERESTING and UNEXPECTED twists and plots ive ever seen in a show, 4 Seasons (WTF i cant believe its only 4 seasons sooooooooo much happens in the show its crazy )

5. *How I met your Mother* - Classic. Perfect fit of characters in love and comedey, i love it because its what id want in college, a group of friends messing around. However you said you dont want a FRIENDS which this is.
[21/04/23, 5:03:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you cannot not like Brooklyn 99 everyone loves it, HIMYM is what you wanted, youll form one proper connection with the show, himym is 9 seasons

[22/04/23, 3:26:16 PM] Himir Desai: Half of the questions are straight simple maths problems the remaining half are subjective with multiple answers. There are only 2 such questions I am saying half because I think they will have more weightage
[22/04/23, 3:26:42 PM] Himir Desai: Because the ask why did you answer that so they want to know your thinking in other questions they just want answers
[22/04/23, 3:26:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i saw the question
[22/04/23, 3:27:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: isn’t it pretty simple, 8

[22/04/23, 3:28:45 PM] Himir Desai: Ha at first read I thought it’s a simple question but then I now think ki I misunderstood the question. Abhi bhi it’s simple only but now I am confused between 2 answers but the more I think one of them becomes more obvious than the other
[22/04/23, 3:30:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: are we speaking about the traffic jam q only
[22/04/23, 3:30:41 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hain

[22/04/23, 3:38:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 7 is the correct choice
[22/04/23, 3:38:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yesyes
[22/04/23, 3:39:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in what other way did you interpret it?

[23/04/23, 7:50:17 PM] Himir Desai: It’s like you do in teams but print 3 separate reports to even if we do inter school it’s not a problem because I won’t be submitting my team name
[23/04/23, 7:50:29 PM] Himir Desai: Ha and it has to be typed not handwritten
[23/04/23, 7:50:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: thats good then

[29/04/23, 4:05:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: On a serious note, about the society bullying for being rich spoilt kids, and us getting deported for such reasons is why i was actually considering not applying at all. But I dont want to go to IIT and theres no other option in India

[01/05/23, 4:51:05 PM] Himir Desai: Ha ye sab to karunga hi first 3 dream next 2 reach and last wala safety
[01/05/23, 4:52:06 PM] Himir Desai: And why did this qsys wale fuckers sent the decision to just 1 student early ya phir he is that much confidence ki he will get through the application
[01/05/23, 4:52:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: PMFAO
[01/05/23, 4:52:24 PM] Ritvick Pandey: nahi yaar
[01/05/23, 4:52:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: no one can be that confident
[01/05/23, 4:52:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: they’re probably sending it in order of application
[01/05/23, 4:52:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: chronological order of application
[01/05/23, 4:52:51 PM] Ritvick Pandey: whoever applied first gets result first
[01/05/23, 4:53:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he must have applied 6 months ago itself
[01/05/23, 4:53:07 PM] Himir Desai: Its not rolling to they will have eneryones decision together so they just have to do one mail merge
[01/05/23, 4:53:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: na they haven’t given
[01/05/23, 4:53:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: a day na
[01/05/23, 4:53:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that everyone will get on this day
[01/05/23, 4:53:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: they’ve said everyone will get BY this day
[01/05/23, 4:53:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hence they’re probably doing this
[01/05/23, 4:53:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: agar ye hota then we should’ve got na
[01/05/23, 4:54:38 PM] Himir Desai: Achha thik and i am confident ki we will get through atlas ka first stage because a friend of mine with no ecs and no standardised test and no olympiads got through
[01/05/23, 4:54:59 PM] Himir Desai: Wahi to is problematic
[01/05/23, 4:55:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: aisa kya
[01/05/23, 4:55:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i still didn’t get time to submit yaar i’ll do it today
[01/05/23, 4:55:14 PM] Himir Desai: They are givjng decision in 3-4 days
[01/05/23, 4:55:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i had to prep for mere sir ka ek exam
[01/05/23, 4:55:20 PM] Himir Desai: After submitting
[01/05/23, 4:55:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: oh sexy
[01/05/23, 4:55:25 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what is round 2?
[01/05/23, 4:55:41 PM] Himir Desai: The same type of thing but more interesting questions and more character limit
[01/05/23, 4:55:50 PM] Himir Desai: 1000 characters
[01/05/23, 4:55:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i have feeling we have
[01/05/23, 4:56:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: a better than good shot at atlas wala

[01/05/23, 4:56:22 PM] Himir Desai: Ha
‎[01/05/23, 4:56:41 PM] Himir Desai: ‎image omitted
[01/05/23, 4:56:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yaar!
[01/05/23, 4:57:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m scared these qs will get me in trouble
[01/05/23, 4:57:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s so tempting to write certain answers
[01/05/23, 4:57:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but i can’t for the sake of getting selected
[01/05/23, 4:57:35 PM] Himir Desai: Bhai i will write some exaggerated thing
[01/05/23, 4:57:46 PM] Ritvick Pandey: mujhe BS bhi nahi karna
[01/05/23, 4:57:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but i’ll have to
[01/05/23, 4:58:45 PM] Himir Desai: Ha and i had that friend ke all answers ki usne kya select kara and his answers are less accurate than mine like mere 10 sahi ho to uske 8-9 hi
[01/05/23, 4:59:21 PM] Ritvick Pandey: kaise gawar friends hai
[01/05/23, 4:59:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: anyways if he got selected then it’s chill
[01/05/23, 4:59:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i just googled atlas application on phone
[01/05/23, 4:59:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: to open up the site
[01/05/23, 5:00:00 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and a reddit group and all came up
[01/05/23, 5:00:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: where people are discussing answers
[01/05/23, 5:00:40 PM] Himir Desai: Ha but remember ki atlas mai ek question hai ki how to reduce cheating and usme ek option tha ki plant wrong answers on all popular websites
[01/05/23, 5:00:50 PM] Himir Desai: It was a multiple correct type question
[01/05/23, 5:00:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i know
[01/05/23, 5:01:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m thinking of that only
[01/05/23, 5:01:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s not like any smart person is going to check the gc anyway i wouldn’t trust anyone’s answer
[01/05/23, 5:01:40 PM] Himir Desai: If they are giving $10K to upto 100 students they are very very smarter than normal population
[01/05/23, 5:01:51 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan exactly
[01/05/23, 5:01:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: plus it’ll get harder to cheat round by round of course
[01/05/23, 5:02:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: which is why i’m sure we have a good
[01/05/23, 5:02:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: a better than good shot at it
[01/05/23, 5:02:13 PM] Himir Desai: Is the final round wo interview wala because if yes then we would get 1000 for that
[01/05/23, 5:02:44 PM] Himir Desai: Just to reach the interview round we get $1000
[01/05/23, 5:02:59 PM] Himir Desai: If that is the final round which ig it is
[01/05/23, 5:03:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hi
[01/05/23, 5:03:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: correct
[01/05/23, 5:03:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I just checked
[01/05/23, 5:03:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 2 written rounds
[01/05/23, 5:03:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and 1-2 interviews
[01/05/23, 5:04:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so interview is final round
[01/05/23, 5:04:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: upto 100 get 10k upto 100 get 1k
[01/05/23, 5:04:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so all who make to interview (upto 100) get 1k im guessing
[01/05/23, 5:04:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: out of those a select will be in the actual program
[01/05/23, 5:04:58 PM] Himir Desai: Ha interview bhi 30-60 minute ka hai to pata nahi kya hoga
[01/05/23, 5:05:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ill toh be going after u
[01/05/23, 5:05:29 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if ur friend passes well both be going after him
[01/05/23, 5:05:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so we should have a basic idea of whats going to happen
[01/05/23, 5:06:26 PM] Himir Desai: If it is this logical reasoning wala interview then i will ace if its ye essay type wala then i will face issue kyuki on the spot jo dimag mai aata wo curated answer se bakwas hi hota
[01/05/23, 5:06:39 PM] Himir Desai: I dont think
[01/05/23, 5:07:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: same
[01/05/23, 5:07:24 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i dont think it will be logical reason wala interview im afraid
[01/05/23, 5:07:29 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what im thinking is
[01/05/23, 5:07:32 PM] Ritvick Pandey: theyll probably ask us
[01/05/23, 5:07:36 PM] Ritvick Pandey: projects weve done
[01/05/23, 5:07:41 PM] Ritvick Pandey: to help the world
[01/05/23, 5:07:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and how the funding would help us
[01/05/23, 5:07:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: theyll definitely ask this one question
[01/05/23, 5:08:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and they might ask stuff like what motivates you and all, basically im guessing essay wale questions
[01/05/23, 5:08:16 PM] Himir Desai: The are not funding us this is a fellowship scholarship its apna paisa
[01/05/23, 5:08:33 PM] Himir Desai: they*
[01/05/23, 5:08:34 PM] Ritvick Pandey: wtf

[01/05/23, 5:09:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: for college
[01/05/23, 5:10:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i thought this was some group for students to make change so theyll tell us to think of shit and then fund it
[01/05/23, 5:10:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: set
[01/05/23, 5:10:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that is dissappointing
‎[01/05/23, 5:10:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[01/05/23, 5:11:33 PM] Himir Desai: What is bayes theorem
‎[01/05/23, 5:11:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[01/05/23, 5:11:55 PM] Himir Desai: Ha to this is good or bad i cant get your tone from the msg
‎[01/05/23, 5:12:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[01/05/23, 5:12:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: accha its two different things
[01/05/23, 5:12:26 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i had read just this earlier
[01/05/23, 5:12:41 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but dekh project equipment also
[01/05/23, 5:12:51 PM] Ritvick Pandey: arrey remember i told u that one q is mindfuck
[01/05/23, 5:12:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: probability wala
[01/05/23, 5:12:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: cuase i dont like probability
[01/05/23, 5:13:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it was easy if u used
[01/05/23, 5:13:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: bayes theorem
[01/05/23, 5:13:20 PM] Himir Desai: Konsa wala that traffic jam?
[01/05/23, 5:13:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but i thought they wont use
[01/05/23, 5:13:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: bayes theorem
[01/05/23, 5:13:14 PM] Ritvick Pandey: cause gore kids are gaawar
[01/05/23, 5:13:24 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but if they mentioned it in home page they probably did use it
[01/05/23, 5:13:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: tujhe theorem pata hoga u just dont know the name
[01/05/23, 5:13:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: basically find
[01/05/23, 5:14:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: probability of some event Y
[01/05/23, 5:14:06 PM] Himir Desai: Ala ye bayes theorem is common sense wearing a coat blazer and trousers
[01/05/23, 5:14:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if event X has taken place
[01/05/23, 5:14:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 🤣🤣🤣
[01/05/23, 5:14:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ur slang is mast ekdum

[01/05/23, 5:14:58 PM] Himir Desai: Jisme there were 3 flavors of jam
[01/05/23, 5:14:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i just skipped past it cause it was probability
[01/05/23, 5:14:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and i absolutely hate PnC and probability
[01/05/23, 5:15:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it was that golden ticket wala
[01/05/23, 5:15:05 PM] Ritvick Pandey: teacher has golden ticket
[01/05/23, 5:15:06 PM] Himir Desai: Strawberry cheery wo wala
[01/05/23, 5:15:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: nahi not jam
[01/05/23, 5:15:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: jam wala was so easy
[01/05/23, 5:15:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: golden ticket
[01/05/23, 5:15:13 PM] Himir Desai: Achha uska to 80%
[01/05/23, 5:15:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan i got 80 i think
[01/05/23, 5:15:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but i used bayes theorem
[01/05/23, 5:15:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and got 18
[01/05/23, 5:15:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: or something like that
[01/05/23, 5:15:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: pata nahi i forgot

[01/05/23, 5:16:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: given ni question
[01/05/23, 5:16:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: idk bro i dont remember ill do the question and tell u
[01/05/23, 5:17:14 PM] Himir Desai: Nahi bayes theorem wont be applicable here because the remaining 15 chocolates were just decoys we know ki usme nahi hai for sure so probability is not equl for all chocolates to bayes theorem not applicable uske liye you need equal probability for pura sample set
[01/05/23, 5:17:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: wtf yaar
[01/05/23, 5:17:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: leave i cant be bothered
[01/05/23, 5:17:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: bas wahi question karna hai
[01/05/23, 5:18:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ill sit it with for 10mins toh ho jayega
[01/05/23, 5:18:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i despise pnc
[01/05/23, 5:18:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and probability
[01/05/23, 5:18:30 PM] Himir Desai: Ha try jitna hard you want and then if you are just like get lost ye question then enter 80 as answer
[01/05/23, 5:18:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: na u cant just
[01/05/23, 5:18:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: consider ki we knew the other 15 are decoy na
[01/05/23, 5:19:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hume still calculate to karna hoga
[01/05/23, 5:19:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: pata nahi bro leave ill try it
[01/05/23, 5:19:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and text u
[01/05/23, 5:19:51 PM] Himir Desai: Ha you try but i am damn sure its 80
[01/05/23, 5:20:39 PM] Himir Desai: We know kyuki it is given in question that none of the other students have got the ticket
[01/05/23, 5:25:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hello
[01/05/23, 5:25:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: bayes theorem
[01/05/23, 5:25:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: will work here
[01/05/23, 5:25:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and using it we will get 0.8
[01/05/23, 5:25:26 PM] Ritvick Pandey: toh ur answer is correct
[01/05/23, 5:25:57 PM] Himir Desai: I to just eye balled the question i adore pnc and probability
[01/05/23, 5:26:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i KNEW youd be the typa person to like it
[01/05/23, 5:26:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: anyway why do u say bayes theorem is not applicable tho i didnt understand
[01/05/23, 5:26:46 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i used it and i got 0.8
[01/05/23, 5:27:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 0.8 as in 80%
[01/05/23, 5:27:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: not 0.8%
[01/05/23, 5:27:59 PM] Himir Desai: Not bayes theorem but many people would just do 1/16*4/5 which is not correct
[01/05/23, 5:28:05 PM] Himir Desai: Bayes correct ho sakta
[01/05/23, 5:28:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan bayes iske liye hi hai
[01/05/23, 5:29:34 PM] Himir Desai: Achha but mai koi bhi theorem ke naam yaad nai karta except L’Hôpital jisme i correct everytime when sir says L Hospital
[01/05/23, 5:31:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan same
[01/05/23, 5:31:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: when i couldnt do the question i went through my book for probabilty
[01/05/23, 5:31:32 PM] Ritvick Pandey: cause i knew the theorem but i forgot what it was
[01/05/23, 5:31:36 PM] Ritvick Pandey: then i saw bayes theorem
[01/05/23, 5:31:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO SAME
[01/05/23, 5:31:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: MY SCHOOL TEACHER KEEPS SAYING hospital

[02/05/23, 2:05:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: has made me realise
[02/05/23, 2:05:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: some people are so sweet
[02/05/23, 2:16:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: Hey Ritvick,

I think there are pros and cons to excluding your scores from your application. If you believe it will hurt your application, I would suggest not submitting your class 11 scores since you would be at peace with how your application looks on paper. If I'm not mistaken, the school counselor doesn't have to submit scores on your behalf for UC Applications, so you wouldn't have to worry about including it in your application.
However, if I were in your position, I would probably include my scores, and explain what happened during the academic year that led to a drop in my performance (I believe there is a section for additional comments). From what I've heard, colleges look at your class 11 scores and your predicted scores from class 12 the most while making their decisions. If they don't see any scores from class 11, they might not take your application as seriously as we would hope they would.

The college admissions process in the US has been and always will be a mystery. There has never been a defined list of activities and scores you need to get into a college, and that's what makes it so ambiguous.

With that being said, I think the decision is ultimately in your hands. After having looked at your LinkedIn, I think you have a strong application regardless of your class 11 scores. I hope colleges see you for the student you are outside of the classroom as well.

Hope this helped!
[02/05/23, 2:16:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this is a ucla wale bhaiya

[02/05/23, 10:03:45 PM] Himir Desai: youtube - Consecutive ads - annoying.

in todays world any online ad that a person sees brings negative connotations in their mind and their first thought is how to skip the ad or get rid of it. 

The solution to this problem is bringing up innovative and unconventional ways of marketing. People should enjoy seeing and reading the ads. 

Today our team, team ace, is going to present ways to change the face of ads once and for all. 

Now I will just quickly show you what all is to come ahead. 

We start by revealing the power of guerrila marketing techniques, then we will go viral using the almighty memes. You loves playing games right? So does everyone else. Adding the attractiveness and adictiveness of games to ads sounds like a good plan too. 

-------------------------------------------------

stop ritvick this wasn't the part of ppt lets move to the next slide
[02/05/23, 10:04:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: Guerrilla marketing is all about thinking outside the box, and finding creative ways to get your message in front of your target audience.

One great example of guerrilla marketing is the famous "Red Bull Stratos" campaign. You may remember this as the time Felix Baumgartner jumped from a helium balloon at the edge of space. The stunt was broadcast live online, and it generated millions of views, making it one of the most successful marketing campaigns in history.

Now, you might be thinking, how does jumping from space promote a drink? But that's the beauty of guerrilla marketing. It catches people off guard, leaves a lasting impression, and gets people talking about your brand.

Social media challenges: Create a fun and engaging social media challenge that encourages users to create and share content related to your brand. One example is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised over $115 million for the ALS Association and helped to raise awareness about the disease.


Memes have become a highly effective marketing tool due to their ability to quickly and humorously convey ideas and emotions. Memes are highly shareable, often relatable, and can help brands connect with their audience on a more personal level.

One successful example of using memes in marketing is the fast-food chain Wendy's. Wendy's has become well-known for its witty and sarcastic social media presence, using memes and clever comebacks to engage with customers online. In 2017, Wendy's responded to a Twitter user's request for a year's supply of chicken nuggets with a challenge to get 18 million retweets. The exchange went viral and became the most retweeted tweet of all time, earning Wendy's millions of impressions and a significant boost in brand awareness.

[03/05/23, 7:18:24 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I'm forced to strongly discourage you from taking the suggested course of action because it doesn't seem to be based on solid judgement or wisdom. I must categorically state that such a plan is foolish since, in my opinion, it would be full of possible hazards and negative effects.
[03/05/23, 7:18:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i wrote this
[03/05/23, 7:18:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and asked chatgpt to make it sound really complex

Regardless 🙈…  My name is Chidinma Okafor a product designer who is currently building a startup (A community that seeks to create access for those who desire to do meaningful work in the world of technology)   My main reasons for joining this group is that I have the desire to contribute to any startup who seeks to make an impact in the future…  Feel free to always Dm if you’re looking for an experienced designer to join your team.

[04/05/23, 10:24:48 PM] Himir Desai: I thought its on the higher side

[04/05/23, 10:24:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: for oxford and all
[04/05/23, 10:25:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the conditional offer will be 96-97 minimumm
[04/05/23, 10:25:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: aur imperial hai toh they did 95
[04/05/23, 10:25:29 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if 95 is the cutoff, it makes things a little easier

[04/05/23, 10:26:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: arrey it wont lemme copy
[04/05/23, 10:26:41 PM] Ritvick Pandey: basically
[04/05/23, 10:26:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: even tho this is an old article
[04/05/23, 10:26:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it says 90%
[04/05/23, 10:26:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ya now that I think of it
[04/05/23, 10:26:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: a conditional offer of 97 would be too fucked
[04/05/23, 10:27:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 90 is extremely doable though
[04/05/23, 10:27:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: also
[04/05/23, 10:27:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: NTU is practically impossible
[04/05/23, 10:27:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: they only take 1 admit per year
[04/05/23, 10:27:51 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so 100% will be reuqired
[04/05/23, 10:27:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in boards
[04/05/23, 10:27:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if we wanna go
[04/05/23, 10:28:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and 100% is fucking impossible pretty much
[04/05/23, 10:28:41 PM] Himir Desai: Ha that is not doable but a necessity if i dont get 90% i will drown in chullubhar pani
[04/05/23, 10:29:23 PM] Himir Desai: Nahi na it would not be that much 97-98
[04/05/23, 10:29:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: LMFAO yeah
[04/05/23, 10:29:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: under 90 would be depressing asf
[04/05/23, 10:29:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yaar
[04/05/23, 10:29:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the bhaiya I talked to
[04/05/23, 10:29:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: from NTU
[04/05/23, 10:29:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: had 100%
[04/05/23, 10:29:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if they only take 1 per year
[04/05/23, 10:30:02 PM] Ritvick Pandey: definitely the 100% wale log are applying
[04/05/23, 10:30:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that means to get in you also have to be 100%
[04/05/23, 10:32:04 PM] Himir Desai: And then aaj ap dene gaya tha to i found 2 other students one who is in our grade and one who has passed 12. And it made me realise ki we are taking things too easy. Like wo 12th pass wale bhaiya got into UCSD and UPenn and CMU mai waitlisted
[04/05/23, 10:32:23 PM] Himir Desai: And he had given 4 APs other ECs i dont know
[04/05/23, 10:33:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: no fucking way
[04/05/23, 10:33:21 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what made u realise were taking things too easy if u dont know the other ECs
[04/05/23, 10:33:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: bro lets do something big with pg4u itll boost our application by a lot
[04/05/23, 10:33:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and we can publish research papers
[04/05/23, 10:33:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I found this lab in blr
[04/05/23, 10:33:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: CFRCE
[04/05/23, 10:34:04 PM] Himir Desai: Then jo hamare grade mai hai he to lives in Vadodara and his mother was super helpful. So like he is in IBDP to udhar to everyone applies in US, UK etc. so she gave me the number of a personal mentor like lady who gets like ivy admissions to her students every year
[04/05/23, 10:34:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: centre for fundamental research and creative education
[04/05/23, 10:34:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: theyll take 4lakh
[04/05/23, 10:34:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but theyll teach me advanced physics

[04/05/23, 10:34:31 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 10th fucking grade bro
[04/05/23, 10:34:37 PM] Himir Desai: For you to it will be easier because you will be applying to mechanical
[04/05/23, 10:34:47 PM] Ritvick Pandey: he didnt finish highschool also he submitted a letter from CFRCE to mit and they accepted it
[04/05/23, 10:35:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but im not sure if ill do it cause its of no use to me as I have no shot in US anyway (11th scores)
[04/05/23, 10:35:25 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it wont be easier na
[04/05/23, 10:35:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: my 11th scores are fucked up
[04/05/23, 10:35:46 PM] Himir Desai: Ha that will make things difficult for you in UK also kyuki predicted scores ko hi dekhte to you will have to get them from your school
[04/05/23, 10:35:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: mujhe bhi bhejna na woh lady ka number
[04/05/23, 10:35:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: no see
[04/05/23, 10:36:02 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if they are giving conditional offer in 90s
[04/05/23, 10:36:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: I can definitely get a predicted score in 90+ if I beg enough
[04/05/23, 10:36:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: hopefully atleast
[04/05/23, 10:36:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so atleast UK theres a shot

[04/05/23, 10:44:35 PM] Himir Desai: Acceptance i mean
[04/05/23, 10:45:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: camrbdige has a better acceptance rate also na

[04/05/23, 10:46:08 PM] Himir Desai: Nahi because less people apply to Cambridge cause more difficult
[04/05/23, 10:46:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i just googled
[04/05/23, 10:46:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: oxford ka 24k ppl applied in 2021
[04/05/23, 10:46:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and cambridge "over 22k" applied in 2021
[04/05/23, 10:47:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: sabkuch toh seems similar
[04/05/23, 10:47:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: plus for cs cambridge is a slight better na
[04/05/23, 10:47:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: anyway im glad ur choosing oxford if we both get in itll be masti
[04/05/23, 10:49:08 PM] Himir Desai: Why were you defending Cambridge
[04/05/23, 10:50:31 PM] Ritvick Pandey: nahi I wasnt defending
[04/05/23, 10:50:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i just thought its a better fit for you as you match all the criteria
[04/05/23, 10:50:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and the ranking of Cambridge is better for cs
[04/05/23, 10:50:51 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but i was wrong
[04/05/23, 10:50:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: oxfords ranking is better for cs

[04/05/23, 10:51:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so you choosing oxford is a wise decision

[04/05/23, 10:52:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: AYE
[04/05/23, 10:52:31 PM] Ritvick Pandey: we might to get meet in the interview centre
[04/05/23, 10:52:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: mumbai or chennai
[04/05/23, 10:52:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i think those are the 2 in india
[04/05/23, 10:52:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but those are for cambridge
[04/05/23, 10:52:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: idk about oxford
[04/05/23, 10:53:13 PM] Himir Desai: In which month is the interview
[04/05/23, 10:53:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: However, interviews are also conducted remotely, for students who cannot travel to the UK to attend their interviews. Oxford conducts interviews via Skype for those who are unable to attend interviews in person. They take place on the same days as all other interviews and follow an identical pattern. Therefore, candidates will normally have two separate interviews, and if there is any preliminary reading to go along with the interview it will usually be e-mailed to your academic referee. It is a misconception to believe that those interviewing over Skype are at a disadvantage as compared to those interviewed in-person,  and should not be a reason to worry for any applicants. If you’re invited to interview at any college, you will be provided with further guidelines for an online interview, which will generally require you to organise that the interview takes place in your current academic institution.
[04/05/23, 10:54:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: december
[04/05/23, 10:54:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: Cambridge works slightly differently in that instead of having online interviews, it conducts a series of overseas interview schemes. Interviews are conducted in different cities around the world and applicants will have to travel to one of these cities, usually the one closest to them. For 2020 entry, the interviews are likely to take place in 7 cities, including Mumbai, which is where most Indian candidates are likely to be interviewed.
[04/05/23, 10:54:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: accha toh if applying to cambrdige
[04/05/23, 10:54:24 PM] Ritvick Pandey: youll have to go to some city in india
[04/05/23, 10:54:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: oxford takes online interview
[04/05/23, 10:54:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: "Interviews are mostly conducted in the first 2 weeks of December"
[04/05/23, 10:55:19 PM] Himir Desai: Just to go Mumbai instead we can meet in London
[04/05/23, 10:55:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: no i didnt mean it in such a way
[04/05/23, 10:55:52 PM] Himir Desai: Heathrow airport is Chumeshwari
[04/05/23, 10:55:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i thought oxford ka would be in mumbai too

[04/05/23, 10:56:06 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i see your point
[04/05/23, 10:56:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: oxford ka process
[04/05/23, 10:56:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: seems a little bit easier
[04/05/23, 10:56:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: compared to cambridge
[04/05/23, 10:56:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: While Oxford accepts CBSE and CISCE results by themselves, Cambridge usually accepts them alongside other additional qualifications.

[04/05/23, 10:58:32 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that translates to 91+ in 4 subjects
[04/05/23, 10:58:40 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i thought a1 would be higher as its percentile wise
[04/05/23, 10:58:40 PM] Himir Desai: Nahi mera current result to A*A*A* hai
[04/05/23, 10:58:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: At Oxford, for courses requiring A*A*A, students with Indian qualifications will be required to achieve 91% or above in 4 out of the 5 papers they sit under CBSE

From November to February, the sun is rarely visible, but from May to August, it shines for an appropriate amount of hours, and in any case, it shines a little more frequently than the rest of Britain (excluding the southern coast).
[05/05/23, 9:53:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan may to august roughly 4 months including others i guess

[12/05/23, 5:41:26 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ru close with him cause then i have more qs
[12/05/23, 5:42:02 PM] Ritvick Pandey: did imperial ask 9-11th separately or did he have to submit 9-11th on UCAS? Was it the same for Oxford?
[12/05/23, 5:42:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: also haan the oxford wala told
[12/05/23, 5:42:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that they have a seperate place
[12/05/23, 5:42:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: to write why u scored less
[12/05/23, 5:42:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if there’s a reason
[12/05/23, 5:42:34 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i forgot the word he used

[12/05/23, 8:53:42 PM] Himir Desai: Kya
[12/05/23, 8:53:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: cause imperial wale told its not required
[12/05/23, 8:53:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and oxford wale said they might depending on country
[12/05/23, 8:53:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yahi
[12/05/23, 8:54:26 PM] Himir Desai: To we also need to send the results separately to each college ya UCAS par hi ye na?
[12/05/23, 8:54:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: nahi I mean
[12/05/23, 8:54:46 PM] Ritvick Pandey: did he upload 9-11 on UCAS
[12/05/23, 8:54:52 PM] Ritvick Pandey: or did imperial ask him separately after seeing his UCAS
[12/05/23, 8:55:05 PM] Ritvick Pandey: cause if we need to submit on UCAS that means all UK colleges require 11th
[12/05/23, 8:55:13 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but if he submitted separately means only imperial asked
[12/05/23, 8:55:43 PM] Himir Desai: Achha puchh liya i will tell you as soon as he replies
[12/05/23, 9:01:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: thanks

[12/05/23, 9:09:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: there’s no retest
[12/05/23, 9:10:29 PM] Himir Desai: Your school is kitna faltu atleast they should give a retest for their mistakes not exactly theirs but they supported it
[12/05/23, 9:13:18 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i know

[12/05/23, 9:13:31 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i asked for a retest but they said itd be unfair practices
[12/05/23, 9:15:18 PM] Himir Desai: One student in Vadodara got 300/300 in jee mains par uska result got currupted 3-4 hours after result came to subah 300/300 sham ko dekha tab 0/300 with all questions unattended par usne High Court mai case kara abhi bhi chal raha ekdum recent baat hai ye 2-3 weeks hue.

[12/05/23, 9:19:29 PM] Himir Desai: You are kitna helpless i feel bad now
[12/05/23, 9:19:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yaar i didn’t expect the UCAS thing
[12/05/23, 9:19:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i feel fucked up now

[13/05/23, 12:00:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: okk
[13/05/23, 12:00:03 AM] Himir Desai: See anyone who would have got into UK would have submitted their 11th grades so they wont know much instead mail the college from some other fake gmail or something or ask counsellors or someone who actually knows
[13/05/23, 12:00:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i asked in the ask us about college thing on imperial ka website
[13/05/23, 12:00:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and the ICSE student said na

[13/05/23, 12:00:51 AM] Himir Desai: Nahi he got 79.2% he was lying in the group msg
[13/05/23, 12:00:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i found imperial ka contact option also and was planning to mail them tomorrow
[13/05/23, 12:01:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i was feeling too fucked up so i went to sleep
[13/05/23, 12:01:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: same with oxford

[13/05/23, 12:02:49 AM] Himir Desai: I asked him to send it kyuki before his 10th boards he was asking me about maths so i asked him to send
[13/05/23, 12:02:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see as far as i think so far-
UCAS you can put only 12th or 9-12th but admission criteria is 12th marks
[13/05/23, 12:03:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan he was asking me about calculus before his math 12th board
[13/05/23, 12:03:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: why matlab
[13/05/23, 12:03:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: a guy who got accepted will know the requirements na
[13/05/23, 12:03:41 AM] Himir Desai: Wo aryan tha

[13/05/23, 12:04:15 AM] Himir Desai: Adarsh
[13/05/23, 12:04:29 AM] Himir Desai: Replying to this
[13/05/23, 12:04:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha
[13/05/23, 12:04:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: why would he fail about lying
[13/05/23, 12:05:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t understand that person at all
[13/05/23, 12:05:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: poor broke family
[13/05/23, 12:05:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but travels daily
[13/05/23, 12:05:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and has a Macbook
[13/05/23, 12:05:39 AM] Himir Desai: Don’t understand him na we are talking important stuff imperial and oxford and all
[13/05/23, 12:05:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yeah exactly
[13/05/23, 12:06:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i can’t believe such an important part of my future may be ruined due to such a thing
[13/05/23, 12:06:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: how frustrating
[13/05/23, 12:06:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ll speak to someone from oxford/imperial tmrw
[13/05/23, 12:06:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: let’s see
[13/05/23, 12:06:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the only good thing is
[13/05/23, 12:06:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: we know for sure now that the interview acceptance is based on the test score
[13/05/23, 12:06:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and i’m intellectually capable enough to ace the PAT
[13/05/23, 12:06:49 AM] Himir Desai: And i was hesitant to go to UK till now because waha they give very less options after our degree gets over but now i realised UT DOESNT MATTER mai wese bhi masters karne wala hu to why am I worried about UK mai expensive settle thodi hona hai
[13/05/23, 12:07:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hence i’m still confident
[13/05/23, 12:07:14 AM] Himir Desai: And Imperial to achha US college gor masters would be easier than BITS se achha US college
[13/05/23, 12:07:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: because end of the day the thing they get to compare me with other students will be PAT score
[13/05/23, 12:07:48 AM] Himir Desai: Ha that to even i am sure after seeing PAT ka paper
[13/05/23, 12:07:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yesss
[13/05/23, 12:08:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i was seeing
[13/05/23, 12:08:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: not seeing
[13/05/23, 12:08:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: thinking
[13/05/23, 12:08:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if we go to UK
[13/05/23, 12:08:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: there’s a lot of colleges
[13/05/23, 12:08:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: first of all
[13/05/23, 12:08:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: credentials-
Bachelors in Engineering, masters in engineering & MBA
[13/05/23, 12:08:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: all from top colleges
[13/05/23, 12:08:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: we’ll have 2 masters
[13/05/23, 12:08:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in same amount of time
[13/05/23, 12:08:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and this too
[13/05/23, 12:09:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: from oxford our journey to harvard business school will be easier than from BITS
[13/05/23, 12:09:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ya
[13/05/23, 12:09:25 AM] Himir Desai: Exactly par agar I directly get into top US college tab to koi question hi nahi hai
[13/05/23, 12:09:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i’ll just get a 100 on PAT
[13/05/23, 12:09:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and explain my 11th scores
[13/05/23, 12:09:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yeah that’s what
[13/05/23, 12:10:59 AM] Himir Desai: MIT,Stanford,Yale,Princeton,Cornell,Caltech,Berkeley>Oxford,Imperial>UCs,GTech,UofT,Waterloo,UBC
[13/05/23, 12:11:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha
[13/05/23, 12:11:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: did not expect that
[13/05/23, 12:12:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: MIT,Stanford,Caltech>Oxford,Imperial>Princeton, Berkeley, UCs,GTech,UofT,Waterloo,UBC
[13/05/23, 12:12:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: mine
[13/05/23, 12:13:33 AM] Himir Desai: See after getting rejected from QSYS i am not sad but i have gotten less confident about getting into top US colleges
[13/05/23, 12:14:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no
[13/05/23, 12:14:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: being honest
[13/05/23, 12:14:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i believe you have a very good shot at Berkeley
[13/05/23, 12:14:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: you show good academic scores throughout, you have good ECs and i love your writing ( i don’t like other ppl ka writing)
[13/05/23, 12:14:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: however for MIT there is no good profile
[13/05/23, 12:15:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: as in theres no guarantee
[13/05/23, 12:15:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that u get in
[13/05/23, 12:15:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no matter what u do
[13/05/23, 12:15:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i saw this bhaiya ka post on linkedin
[13/05/23, 12:15:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: he had fucking 4-5 OLYMPIAD MEDALS BRO
[13/05/23, 12:15:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: Chem
[13/05/23, 12:15:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: Math
[13/05/23, 12:15:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and Astronomy
[13/05/23, 12:15:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yet he got rejected from MIT
[13/05/23, 12:15:42 AM] Himir Desai: Berkeley is a good uni but i am still not confident now it will take some days to get that confidence back
[13/05/23, 12:15:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but he went to IIT bombay CSE
[13/05/23, 12:15:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this year he applied for transfer to MIT and got accepted
[13/05/23, 12:16:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t rmeneber
[13/05/23, 12:16:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but it was a lot of olympiad achievement
[13/05/23, 12:16:12 AM] Himir Desai: MIT mujhe dil se nahi jana agar they accept me then i will definitely go but the decision would be from mind not heart
[13/05/23, 12:16:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha
[13/05/23, 12:16:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for me MIT has always been from heart
[13/05/23, 12:16:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my uncle and dad studied something there
[13/05/23, 12:16:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and ever since i’m a kid
[13/05/23, 12:16:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i hear about how great it is
[13/05/23, 12:16:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and it’s excellence
[13/05/23, 12:17:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and it just made me feel how it’s the best of the best
[13/05/23, 12:17:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: which is what i wanna be ( which is why MIT APPEALS to me so much )
[13/05/23, 12:17:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha
[13/05/23, 12:17:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see that’s another UK college plus
[13/05/23, 12:17:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: u know the entire process
[13/05/23, 12:17:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so you know if ur getting in or not

[13/05/23, 12:18:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan yahi
[13/05/23, 12:18:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: how good is this MFs profile
[13/05/23, 12:18:56 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and he still got rejected
[13/05/23, 12:19:00 AM] Himir Desai: UK ka i dont have problem as of now maybe usme bhi confidence chala jae after Atlas who knows
[13/05/23, 12:19:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bhai trust me
[13/05/23, 12:19:15 AM] Himir Desai: I said na US is a lottery
[13/05/23, 12:19:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i usually only trust my intellect ability cause of how much i love myself
[13/05/23, 12:19:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but you’re for sure a top applicant
[13/05/23, 12:19:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but now no matter how good ur profile is
[13/05/23, 12:19:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: exactly
[13/05/23, 12:19:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: a college like MIT is lottery
[13/05/23, 12:21:01 AM] Himir Desai: I just want things to get over matlab its not the decision which makes me feel sad or depressed or anything ots the wait
[13/05/23, 12:21:37 AM] Himir Desai: Abhi i got QSYS ka decision to i will move on as simple as that but the past few days i dont know if it was that or something else i want happy
[13/05/23, 12:22:12 AM] Himir Desai: Abhi i have decided to play basketball every week will a friend of mine others will come if they will but even if noone comes we both will go
[13/05/23, 12:22:32 AM] Himir Desai: Kyuki i have heard ki sports se mental health sudharti
[13/05/23, 12:22:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i understand bro
[13/05/23, 12:22:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan
[13/05/23, 12:22:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: good u started
[13/05/23, 12:22:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’ll make u fitter also
[13/05/23, 12:22:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i heard the same
[13/05/23, 12:23:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: which is why i added gym to schedule even tho i was so busy already
[13/05/23, 12:23:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see
[13/05/23, 12:23:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t want to be that guy
[13/05/23, 12:23:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but literally everyone or anywhere you go
[13/05/23, 12:23:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in whatever country
[13/05/23, 12:23:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or whatever religion
[13/05/23, 12:23:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: one line that’s common i’ve seen is
[13/05/23, 12:24:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if you want something bad enough / if you work hard enough for something no matter what happens you get it somehow
[13/05/23, 12:24:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i know it sounds like BS cause i always thought it did
[13/05/23, 12:24:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but if u think about it there’s nothing u can do other than working as hard as possible
[13/05/23, 12:24:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so might as well
[13/05/23, 12:24:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ho jaye toh great
[13/05/23, 12:24:59 AM] Himir Desai: My reasoning for anything that happens whenever is that god has planned things for you already this is a bump in the grand plan
[13/05/23, 12:25:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: even if not it’s fine kidhar aur hojayega
[13/05/23, 12:25:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha
[13/05/23, 12:25:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my mum says that
[13/05/23, 12:25:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see himir
[13/05/23, 12:25:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: both you and i na
[13/05/23, 12:25:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: regardless of where we go
[13/05/23, 12:25:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: we’ll be fucking loaded for sure
[13/05/23, 12:25:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: fucking loaded as in v rich
[13/05/23, 12:25:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: plus
[13/05/23, 12:25:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: whatever worst case happens
[13/05/23, 12:26:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s not like we’ll go to DU
[13/05/23, 12:26:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so we’ll still have a little edge over others
[13/05/23, 12:26:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: basically koi na koi good college mai hojayega
[13/05/23, 12:26:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: don’t stress
[13/05/23, 12:27:43 AM] Himir Desai: College ka stress nahi hai mujhe its like ki ham kaam kar rahe hai but point kya sabka and wahi existential wali chiz but ab its even worse kyuki now its like grind for 1 more year and see if you won the lottery or not
[13/05/23, 12:31:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: oh that
[13/05/23, 12:31:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: uska to kuch nahi kar sakte hai
[13/05/23, 12:31:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i had texted you due to the same reason na
[13/05/23, 12:31:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see
[13/05/23, 12:31:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: even if it seems pointless rn
[13/05/23, 12:31:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: do it anyway
[13/05/23, 12:31:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: because after some point
[13/05/23, 12:31:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: when ur feeling better and it doesn’t seem pointless
[13/05/23, 12:32:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ull be in a fuckall situation because u didn’t do it rn
[13/05/23, 12:32:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: do anything rn*
[13/05/23, 12:32:13 AM] Himir Desai: What is feel better if i know that i will feel worse in a few days
[13/05/23, 12:32:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: na trust me it’ll get better eventually
[13/05/23, 12:32:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for ex- in 11th i was feeling this and then the whole incident happened and i fucked that test
[13/05/23, 12:32:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i was feeling like that so i didn’t bother doing anything
[13/05/23, 12:32:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: saying how does anything matter anyway
[13/05/23, 12:33:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but if i were there rn ( as in me in my current mental health not that times) i’d do a lot more
[13/05/23, 12:33:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’d fight with the teachers
[13/05/23, 12:33:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: change schools and get retest
[13/05/23, 12:33:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: etc etc
[13/05/23, 12:33:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i didn’t do anything
[13/05/23, 12:33:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and now the current me is getting fucked for it
[13/05/23, 12:33:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so even if it feels useless do it anyway
[13/05/23, 12:34:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so your future himir doesn’t get fucked
[13/05/23, 12:34:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and even if there isn’t a future himir who feels better
[13/05/23, 12:34:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then also u don’t lose anything working hard cause if nothing matters whatever u do won’t matter
[13/05/23, 12:34:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so might as well work hard
[13/05/23, 12:34:48 AM] Himir Desai: OK BHAI NOW MY MOTTO IS GO PLAY BASKETBALL TOMORROW AND THEN DO SUPER HARD WORK TILL I GET INTO ANY COLLEGE KOI SI BHI AND LIVE THERE HAPPILY
[13/05/23, 12:35:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: YES

[13/05/23, 12:35:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: chal enjoy karna kal i’ll go sleep
[13/05/23, 12:38:45 AM] Himir Desai: Ala that is because abhi ke jivan mai that is the only source of happiness
[13/05/23, 12:39:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha ok karlo

[13/05/23, 11:05:17 PM] Himir Desai: Unless i get a full nights sleep of 10 hours which will waste even more time
[13/05/23, 11:05:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i could do 4.5-3 hours split
[13/05/23, 11:05:40 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ll test this out

[13/05/23, 11:06:51 PM] Himir Desai: Ha but isme i think ki after waking up each time your sleep wont be full to you will be sleepy for next hour
[13/05/23, 11:07:14 PM] Ritvick Pandey: nahi thats the good part
[13/05/23, 11:07:19 PM] Himir Desai: Also mere sleep ka indicator is my eyes if i dont sleep well one night next entire day my eyes water

[14/05/23, 7:08:40 PM] Himir Desai: Its 700 in english but most of the mistakes are because i rushed through the questions. I thought I wouldn’t get time so i did all the grammar questions fast without reading pura context and so got many of those wrong

[20/05/23, 4:50:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i messaged UCAS regarding what scores to submit
[20/05/23, 4:50:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: Hi Ritvick, 

Thank you for your message.

In your application you need to include all qualifications from secondary school onwards. 
Yes the course requirements do vary for each university so you may need to double check these before applying.

Thanks, Stacey
[20/05/23, 4:50:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and got this response
[20/05/23, 4:51:35 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I then sent a mail to Imperial College London's faculty of engineering
[20/05/23, 4:51:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and got this response
[20/05/23, 4:51:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: Hello,

While your previous year grades are an indicator we use when looking at applications, we look more at your predicted grades as a concrete indicator. You will need to include those grades however, as the department that assesses your application will want to see them.

Kind regards,

Mr Yarun Sivadhass | Faculty Admissions Officer – Faculty of Engineering
[20/05/23, 4:51:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: its not looking too good
[20/05/23, 4:54:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but its not bad at all either, as a good 12th score improvement along with a good score on their test should surely get atleast an interview
[20/05/23, 8:44:59 AM] Himir Desai: If you get your school to give you good predicted then they will see a huge improvement and hence read the optional essay explaining bad marks where you will explain it to them
[20/05/23, 8:45:22 AM] Himir Desai: To its not to difficult if you get good predicted
[20/05/23, 8:45:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yes its not too difficult
[20/05/23, 8:45:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I got the syllabus for the first test

[26/05/23, 2:57:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: accha also I wanted your opinion on one thing
[26/05/23, 2:57:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in this research program, ive been assigned this topic -
[26/05/23, 2:57:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been known to be involved in the mechanism that causes numerous neurological disorders like migraine, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. In many cases when these events occur, the patient is usually asleep and not constantly connected to an EEG device to catch the spontaneous EEG activity spreading across the cortical surface. Design a low cost, portable device that patients can use at-home without interfering with their quality of life to perform real-time analysis of spontaneous brain waves that provides a warning towards neurological disorders warning patients to seek professional medical attention.
[26/05/23, 2:58:22 PM] Ritvick Pandey: do you think I shud ask for a switch to a more math/phy related topic or that this is p cool
[26/05/23, 2:58:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: designing a portable device would help in mech eng
[26/05/23, 4:04:20 PM] Himir Desai: Mai reply karta hu
[26/05/23, 5:20:01 PM] Himir Desai: Abhi class mai hu
[27/05/23, 12:22:17 AM] Himir Desai: I think that if you do do this and make a portable device which does all this it would be cool asf but you should also consider how much time it will take and will you be able to make one before the college applications
[27/05/23, 12:23:20 AM] Himir Desai: Like i dont know how much time of your it will take. If it doesn’t take much then this would be a solid EC
[27/05/23, 12:23:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hello
[27/05/23, 12:24:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan abhi I have started to focus very less time on ECs since usa is pretty much gone now
[27/05/23, 12:24:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: abhi bas math aur physics padh raha hoon

[02/06/23, 12:45:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: maine partial fraction Pehle kiya
[02/06/23, 12:45:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then i found the expansion
[02/06/23, 12:46:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i had to rewrite properly to send to sir
[02/06/23, 12:46:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so in reality, step 2 is step 1
[02/06/23, 12:46:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and step1 was my step 2
[02/06/23, 12:46:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: since my writing is a bit confusing i have written what i did so as others can understand

[02/06/23, 12:49:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or is it a glitch
[02/06/23, 12:50:09 AM] Himir Desai: Ye concept mujhe pata hai but hame officially ye integration mai sikhaenge. Allen ya atleast allen Vadodara mai bohot ulta sidha chalta like last year limits hame touch bhi nahi kiya wo abhi karaya similarly last year hamne organic touch bhi nahi kara wo bhi abhi shuru karaya hai
[02/06/23, 12:50:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: nahi i dont think ye concept padhayenge
[02/06/23, 12:50:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this question se
[02/06/23, 12:50:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: sir removed the limits
[02/06/23, 12:50:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: to make it easier
[02/06/23, 12:50:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so it was just a sequences question
[02/06/23, 12:50:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: aur koi concept nahi hai
[02/06/23, 12:51:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: partial fractions hai but woh toh 10th mai padthe hain
‎[02/06/23, 12:51:10 AM] Himir Desai: ‎image omitted
[02/06/23, 12:51:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: aur e^x ka expansion limits mai hai
[02/06/23, 12:51:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: warna its a sequence q
[02/06/23, 12:51:43 AM] Himir Desai: Nahi i am talking about breaking the expression using that A B C thing
[02/06/23, 12:52:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan that is called partial fractions
[02/06/23, 12:52:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: woh integration mai nahi
[02/06/23, 12:52:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 10th mai hota hai
[02/06/23, 12:52:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: humare liye deleted tha

[02/06/23, 12:53:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: mujhe bhi nahi pata tha partial fractions, mere neighbour wale sir mujhe padhai the, earlier this year
[02/06/23, 12:53:05 AM] Himir Desai: 10th mai ham TIM batch mai the to hame 11th ke and 12th ke basic concepts batae to 10th wala bas boards jitna kara
[02/06/23, 12:53:13 AM] Himir Desai: Ye bata sahi ki galat
[02/06/23, 12:53:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yaar

[02/06/23, 12:53:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan
[02/06/23, 12:54:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: silly mistake hogaya tha mujhse
[02/06/23, 12:54:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: mene expand karke kiya
[02/06/23, 12:54:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and i got ln 6/7
[02/06/23, 12:55:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: actually, 1 - 1/7 ke jage it is 1+1/7
[02/06/23, 12:56:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: what have u done I dont understand it
[02/06/23, 12:56:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i hate logarithmic functions
‎[02/06/23, 12:59:10 AM] Himir Desai: ‎image omitted
[02/06/23, 12:59:27 AM] Himir Desai: I messed with the signs

[02/06/23, 1:01:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha
[02/06/23, 1:01:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I did the same
[02/06/23, 1:01:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i thought
[02/06/23, 1:01:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: u used some
[02/06/23, 1:01:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: shortcut log trick
[02/06/23, 1:01:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: which i dont know about
[02/06/23, 1:01:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i skipped logarithmic functions in 11th
[02/06/23, 1:01:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: as i did nothing in 11th
[02/06/23, 1:01:39 AM] Himir Desai: Nahi its just i did in my head (and so got the signs wrong)
[02/06/23, 1:01:59 AM] Himir Desai: Mains level question even less
[02/06/23, 1:02:05 AM] Himir Desai: Ye wala jo tha wo
‎[02/06/23, 1:02:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[02/06/23, 1:02:56 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i also screwed the sign initially
[02/06/23, 1:03:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan this wasn’t that bad
[02/06/23, 1:03:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha chalo goodnight
[02/06/23, 1:03:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i have school tomorrow morning
[02/06/23, 1:03:37 AM] Himir Desai: Ek aur koi bhej de phir sota hu
[02/06/23, 1:03:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: LMAO
[02/06/23, 1:03:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ye karle
[02/06/23, 1:04:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: its not as mindfuck as the first one
[02/06/23, 1:04:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but its p decent
[02/06/23, 1:04:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i only couldnt do this because i had forgotten one expansion
[02/06/23, 1:04:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: agar tujhe yaad hai tab 1 min mai hojayega
[02/06/23, 1:04:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: mujhe hit karne mai 5mins laga
‎[02/06/23, 1:04:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[02/06/23, 1:04:51 AM] Himir Desai: Then look up you just need to know something like that exists not the pura formula formula you will automatically remember with practice
[02/06/23, 1:05:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hmm
[02/06/23, 1:05:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: acha if you want more of the “mind fuck” wala section let me know i’ll send tomorrow morning
[02/06/23, 1:05:44 AM] Himir Desai: Ha ok
[02/06/23, 1:05:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: abhi sone ja raaha hoon
[02/06/23, 1:05:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: iska solution bhej dena
‎[02/06/23, 1:07:23 AM] Himir Desai: ‎image omitted
[02/06/23, 1:09:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: perfect
[02/06/23, 1:09:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I had forgotten basels problem
[02/06/23, 1:09:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: warna its easy
[02/06/23, 1:10:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: proud of u my friend, goodnight
[02/06/23, 1:10:28 AM] Himir Desai: Ye sab naam kya hai ye yaad rakhne ki vajah se formulae bhul jate dimag mai storage limited hai waste na kari
[02/06/23, 1:10:31 AM] Himir Desai: Karo*
[02/06/23, 1:10:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I dont remember names ever!
[02/06/23, 1:10:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hadn't I told u this
[02/06/23, 1:10:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I dont remember anytihng ka naam
[02/06/23, 1:10:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but basels problem is very famous
[02/06/23, 1:11:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: toh yaad rah gaya
[02/06/23, 1:11:11 AM] Himir Desai: Not enough for ne to know its name
[02/06/23, 1:11:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: plus mene 10th mai kiya tha
[02/06/23, 1:11:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so I forgot
[02/06/23, 1:11:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 11th I didnt do shit na
[02/06/23, 1:11:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 10th also I didnt, early 10th ya 9th end mai
[02/06/23, 1:12:06 AM] Himir Desai: Achha tab to mai INJSO de raha rha tha jisme maths nahi aata to maths mera tab NCERT level hi tha
[02/06/23, 1:12:41 AM] Himir Desai: Thike to so jate good night
[02/06/23, 1:31:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hello
[02/06/23, 1:31:29 AM] Himir Desai: Achha mujhe ekdum se yaad aaya why I didn’t know that partial fraction wala theory its because that entire thing is a waste of time and I do exactly the same thing everyday in my mind (the method I use is more of a repurposed method to do something else but it works really fast).

I will tell you tomorrow mai kya karta hu
[02/06/23, 1:31:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: arrey same, I do a similar sort of thing in my mind which is why I always remember
[02/06/23, 1:32:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: like algebra also
[02/06/23, 1:32:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: when I was a kid
[02/06/23, 1:32:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i did algebra
[02/06/23, 1:32:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: instead of x
[02/06/23, 1:32:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i wrote
[02/06/23, 1:32:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: "something something"
[02/06/23, 1:32:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: also
[02/06/23, 1:32:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i googled it
[02/06/23, 1:32:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: u and allen Vadodara were correct
[02/06/23, 1:32:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: partial fration integration ke saath phirse padhaya jaata hai
[02/06/23, 1:32:45 AM] Himir Desai: Achha
[02/06/23, 1:32:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan
‎[02/06/23, 1:33:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[02/06/23, 1:33:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: mujhe neend nahi aa rahi
[02/06/23, 1:33:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha morning ko batana
[02/06/23, 1:34:03 AM] Himir Desai: If i ask you to factorise x^3 + x^2 - x - 1 jiska one factor is (x-1) what will you do
[02/06/23, 1:34:33 AM] Himir Desai: Kal dekhta hu
[02/06/23, 1:34:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i will divide by x-1
[02/06/23, 1:35:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and get the other factors
[02/06/23, 1:35:11 AM] Himir Desai: Ha that is obvious but how will you divide
[02/06/23, 1:35:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: LMAO wdym
[02/06/23, 1:35:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: kal sube batana im too tired for this
[02/06/23, 1:35:34 AM] Himir Desai: How will you divide
[02/06/23, 1:35:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ye morning ki charcha hai
[02/06/23, 1:35:48 AM] Himir Desai: Like bachpan mai long division sikhate the usse
[02/06/23, 1:36:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i j divide it in my mind
[02/06/23, 1:36:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: technically
[02/06/23, 1:36:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: im using
[02/06/23, 1:36:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: long division
[02/06/23, 1:36:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in my mind
[02/06/23, 1:36:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so yes i guess?
[02/06/23, 1:37:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i think i understand
[02/06/23, 1:37:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: what u say
[02/06/23, 1:37:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ur going to do
[02/06/23, 1:38:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: kya tumhe pata hai this year Olympiads kab hoyenge
[02/06/23, 1:38:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and if we write, will results come in time
[02/06/23, 1:38:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or should we have written the 2022 one
[02/06/23, 1:38:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: prmo sept ko hoga na
[02/06/23, 1:39:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: shit
[02/06/23, 1:39:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: its too late
[02/06/23, 1:39:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: you've been typing since a while its scary
[02/06/23, 1:39:43 AM] Himir Desai: Technically nahi jana hai. Like mai kya karta hu first I write (x-1)( 
then what should i put in bracket to get largest power of x in expression so it will be
(x-1)(x^2
Then again next largest power is 2 jiska coefficient 1 hai but we already have -x^2 using -1 and x^2 to now i will add 2x to 
(x-1)(x^2 + 2x
Now i have -2x extra but i need -x so i will add 1 to 
(x-1)(x^2 + 2x +1) and everything done this is what i do and i get answer in 3-4 seconds
[02/06/23, 1:40:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yes
[02/06/23, 1:40:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this is
[02/06/23, 1:40:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the logn
[02/06/23, 1:40:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: divison method na
[02/06/23, 1:40:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this is what I mean, I do in my mind
[02/06/23, 1:40:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: btu technically
[02/06/23, 1:40:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: its long divison method
[02/06/23, 1:40:51 AM] Himir Desai: Lot of low scoring students actually write down and do pura division
[02/06/23, 1:41:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan toh retards toh woh karenge na
[02/06/23, 1:41:11 AM] Himir Desai: Its like long division but remainders you keep in mind
[02/06/23, 1:41:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ya most of the avg log bhi
[02/06/23, 1:41:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: they fail off anyway
[02/06/23, 1:41:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan its not too tough
[02/06/23, 1:41:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: I dont see why dumb ppl also dont do this
[02/06/23, 1:41:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: likhne mai kitna time waste ho jayega
[02/06/23, 1:41:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ive seen a similar thing
[02/06/23, 1:42:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: rationalise karte wakt bhi
[02/06/23, 1:42:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: people keep rewriting the entire thing
[02/06/23, 1:42:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: instead of simply substituting values if its not 0 anymore
[02/06/23, 1:42:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: u save like 30-40 seconds
[02/06/23, 1:42:24 AM] Himir Desai: Maths mai to i skip majority if steps
[02/06/23, 1:42:35 AM] Himir Desai: of*
[02/06/23, 1:42:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: same, but my sir has asked me to write down step by step
[02/06/23, 1:42:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: since he says
[02/06/23, 1:42:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i will make mistakes
[02/06/23, 1:42:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: warna most of my math is incomprehendable
[02/06/23, 1:42:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in/un ?
[02/06/23, 1:43:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i j write 1-2 steps anywhere i find space
[02/06/23, 1:43:17 AM] Himir Desai: aur iska matlab
[02/06/23, 1:43:27 AM] Himir Desai: In
[02/06/23, 1:43:38 AM] Himir Desai: Incomprehensible *
‎[02/06/23, 1:43:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
‎[02/06/23, 1:44:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[02/06/23, 1:44:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: writing steps does help i suppose
[02/06/23, 1:44:34 AM] Himir Desai: Exactly i gave 2 full jee papers in last month and people used 6-7 rough sheets and some even 10 sheets for the 75 questions jabki i used 0 i did everything in the qpaper itself
[02/06/23, 1:45:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: same!!
[02/06/23, 1:45:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s weird how we do a lot of things alike
[02/06/23, 1:45:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but my sir keeps telling me
[02/06/23, 1:45:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: thay i’m too stupid
[02/06/23, 1:45:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: to skip steps
[02/06/23, 1:45:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and he knew some ppl at IIT
[02/06/23, 1:45:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: CSE wale
[02/06/23, 1:46:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: those were the ones who are allowed to skip sets
[02/06/23, 1:46:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: steps*
[02/06/23, 1:46:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and he tells me how i’m not even close to cse level so i should write steps
[02/06/23, 1:46:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then he hurts my ego a bit more
[02/06/23, 1:46:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i have started to try
[02/06/23, 1:46:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this works so much better tho
[02/06/23, 1:46:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: answer is always correct + time is saved
[02/06/23, 1:47:43 AM] Himir Desai: Our teachers are a lot less realist warma 90% population would be depressed kyuki they wont even get into IIT any field
[02/06/23, 1:48:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: fuck u mean realist
[02/06/23, 1:48:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: im not a retard
[02/06/23, 1:48:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: LMAO
[02/06/23, 1:48:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hes just showing "tough love"
[02/06/23, 1:48:47 AM] Himir Desai: I don’t know your teachers i am talking about mine
[02/06/23, 1:48:53 AM] Himir Desai: Yeah
[02/06/23, 1:49:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no i’m joking, you said your is a lot less realist, which implies mine is, but mine said i’m a retard
[02/06/23, 1:49:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no but for real
[02/06/23, 1:49:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my sir is a lot like us
[02/06/23, 1:49:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: plus i like him a lot since he’s always for real
[02/06/23, 1:50:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: woh directly muh pe chutiya bula dete hai
[02/06/23, 1:50:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this i didn’t expect though
[02/06/23, 1:50:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: as far as i’ve heard they’re very rude in coachings
[02/06/23, 1:50:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: rude as in realistic
[02/06/23, 1:51:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: like they’ll straight up tell students they can’t get Iit
[02/06/23, 1:51:21 AM] Himir Desai: They never do that here
[02/06/23, 1:51:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i mean my perception is based off of a tv show (kota factory)
[02/06/23, 1:52:17 AM] Himir Desai: They instead give other options like in addition to IITs also prepare for BITSAT VITEEE SRMJEE etc
[02/06/23, 1:52:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: accha
[02/06/23, 1:52:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my sir says if i write viteee he won’t claim me as his student
[02/06/23, 1:52:53 AM] Himir Desai: I have not seen that but kota and Vadodara are different places kota mai i have been they can be harse here its nice and loving and all
[02/06/23, 1:52:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the only college in india he is fine with other than IIT is BITS pilani
[02/06/23, 1:53:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but that is probably because he’s from IIT
[02/06/23, 1:53:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ve seen a lot of IITians have an obsession about
[02/06/23, 1:53:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: being from IIT
[02/06/23, 1:53:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: they base their entire life on that
[02/06/23, 1:53:33 AM] Himir Desai: VITEEE is not a admission test its a fee reduction test kyuki even 50000 rank would get CS if he pays more
[02/06/23, 1:53:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s like that for alot colleges
[02/06/23, 1:54:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: all here in Karnataka
[02/06/23, 1:54:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: they’re pvt and govt both
[02/06/23, 1:54:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: govt if u get seat
[02/06/23, 1:54:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: pvt if u don’t
[02/06/23, 1:54:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: like u can get PES from mains and have very less fees, or pay a lot and get in
[02/06/23, 1:55:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i don’t see a point in getting a btech from any of these colleges, engineers here are paid less than swiggy drivers
[02/06/23, 1:55:05 AM] Himir Desai: Here Gujarat mai there are not a lot of high placement colleges i would even couns for one or two IIT Gamdhinagar mai utne achhe nahi there is one DAIICT usme thik thak hai
[02/06/23, 1:55:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: you know engineers are very well respect outside of india?
[02/06/23, 1:55:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i was shocked
[02/06/23, 1:55:21 AM] Himir Desai: Try
[02/06/23, 1:55:25 AM] Himir Desai: True*
[02/06/23, 1:55:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: apparently when u tell ppl ur an engineer
[02/06/23, 1:55:35 AM] Ritvick Pandey: they’re taken aback
[02/06/23, 1:55:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and instantly respect you
[02/06/23, 1:56:01 AM] Himir Desai: But computer science is not an engineering degree
[02/06/23, 1:56:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: since i’m from india and every 2nd person is an engineer i didn’t think it’s a big deal
[02/06/23, 1:56:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: respected*
[02/06/23, 1:56:12 AM] Himir Desai: Outside of indiq
[02/06/23, 1:56:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m talking about engineering in general not just cs
[02/06/23, 1:56:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but there is computer engineering in a lot of colleges
[02/06/23, 1:56:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in the US
[02/06/23, 1:56:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know how it’s different from cs but i know it is
[02/06/23, 1:56:57 AM] Himir Desai: Ha ik i am saying ki CS isn’t engineering in USA
[02/06/23, 1:56:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i didn’t bother checking
[02/06/23, 1:57:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i think that is for hardware
[02/06/23, 1:57:08 AM] Himir Desai: That is hardware atudf
[02/06/23, 1:57:11 AM] Himir Desai: Stuff*
[02/06/23, 1:57:40 AM] Himir Desai: UC Berkeley gives a BA in CS
[02/06/23, 1:57:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hmm
[02/06/23, 1:57:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: wtf
[02/06/23, 1:57:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that’s so
[02/06/23, 1:57:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: demeaning
[02/06/23, 1:57:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 💀💀
[02/06/23, 1:58:17 AM] Himir Desai: But majority give BSc or BS
[02/06/23, 1:58:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan
[02/06/23, 1:58:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i want this one degree bro
[02/06/23, 1:58:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s this
[02/06/23, 1:58:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: perfect program
[02/06/23, 1:58:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but the course
[02/06/23, 1:58:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: isn’t available
[02/06/23, 1:58:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in any decent college
[02/06/23, 1:58:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: mechatronics with
[02/06/23, 1:58:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: electrical mechanical and cs
[02/06/23, 1:59:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: uff 😩
[02/06/23, 1:59:40 AM] Himir Desai: I found one excellent program which is computer science with business dual degree but that is also not available in good colleges (i will have to check though)
[02/06/23, 1:59:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: best i found so far in a good college is mechatronics (electrical+ mechanical+ entrepreneurship ) from purdue but it’s from purdue polytechnic university not a bachelors degree
[02/06/23, 1:59:56 AM] Himir Desai: Then you get BSc and BBA
[02/06/23, 2:00:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: NTU!
[02/06/23, 2:00:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s the hardest to get into course in NTU
[02/06/23, 2:00:22 AM] Himir Desai: I am just talking about US
[02/06/23, 2:00:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: cs and business
[02/06/23, 2:00:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: oh ok
[02/06/23, 2:00:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then i don’t know
[02/06/23, 2:00:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m pretty sure
[02/06/23, 2:00:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be there in Stanford
[02/06/23, 2:00:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it should be there
[02/06/23, 2:00:41 AM] Himir Desai: I haven’t checked
[02/06/23, 2:00:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: stanford is famous for both
[02/06/23, 2:01:08 AM] Himir Desai: SAT khatam hone ke baad i would be finalising my college list in 1-2 weeks
[02/06/23, 2:01:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in fact, before Cs, economics was the most popular degree at stanford
[02/06/23, 2:01:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i see
[02/06/23, 2:01:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ve no time
[02/06/23, 2:01:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bro reality checks
[02/06/23, 2:01:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: have hit me hard
[02/06/23, 2:01:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no abroad colleges
[02/06/23, 2:01:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and only 6 months for entire jee
[02/06/23, 2:01:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m screwed bro
[02/06/23, 2:01:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭💀💀
[02/06/23, 2:02:05 AM] Himir Desai: Dont kill yourself though
[02/06/23, 2:02:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no, that is if i’m not rich
[02/06/23, 2:02:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so that is at 30
[02/06/23, 2:02:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: not now
[02/06/23, 2:02:29 AM] Himir Desai: Have you seen IIMs?
[02/06/23, 2:02:34 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and it’s very not probable
[02/06/23, 2:02:35 AM] Himir Desai: Ya IISc?
[02/06/23, 2:02:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: IISc requires
[02/06/23, 2:02:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: <air200 in advanced
[02/06/23, 2:02:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’d rather do iitk cs
[02/06/23, 2:03:00 AM] Himir Desai: That’s just IISc Bangalore
[02/06/23, 2:03:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if i get <200
[02/06/23, 2:03:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no see
[02/06/23, 2:03:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: any good indian college
[02/06/23, 2:03:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ll have to finish
[02/06/23, 2:03:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: jee adv level syllabus
[02/06/23, 2:03:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 11th and 12th
[02/06/23, 2:03:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in 6 months
[02/06/23, 2:03:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: which i can do
[02/06/23, 2:03:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i really don’t want to
[02/06/23, 2:03:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i still wanna apply abroad
[02/06/23, 2:03:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: even though there’s p much no chance
[02/06/23, 2:03:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my best shot at abroad would be oxford, by acing the PAT
[02/06/23, 2:04:11 AM] Himir Desai: But you would not prefer a lower (relatively) college abroad
[02/06/23, 2:04:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no
[02/06/23, 2:04:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: lower as in
[02/06/23, 2:04:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: how low
[02/06/23, 2:04:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m not applying to something like Penn state
[02/06/23, 2:04:49 AM] Himir Desai: Uska department rank is good na
[02/06/23, 2:04:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no yaar
[02/06/23, 2:05:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: everyone
[02/06/23, 2:05:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: gets accepted
[02/06/23, 2:05:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t wanna go to such a college
[02/06/23, 2:05:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: plus i’ll get trolled
[02/06/23, 2:05:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: by entire family
[02/06/23, 2:05:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in UP
[02/06/23, 2:05:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: failures who can’t get indian college
[02/06/23, 2:05:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: go to a lower US college
[02/06/23, 2:05:47 AM] Himir Desai: if you apply doesn’t mean you have to go but you must have some worst case safety measures
[02/06/23, 2:05:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no like
[02/06/23, 2:05:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if my halat
[02/06/23, 2:06:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: is as bad as penn state
[02/06/23, 2:06:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then i won’t go to college only
[02/06/23, 2:06:16 AM] Himir Desai: And then do pura JEE ka prep so that you can say no i wont come to your college on their faces
[02/06/23, 2:06:32 AM] Himir Desai: And then you will be trolled as barvi pass
[02/06/23, 2:06:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but that’s the issue na i don’t wanna do 14hiurs a day jee, and if i do then i don’t have time to apply outside
[02/06/23, 2:06:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s better than
[02/06/23, 2:06:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: penn stated
[02/06/23, 2:07:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ll j take gap year n apply next time
[02/06/23, 2:07:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but it won’t get to that
[02/06/23, 2:07:13 AM] Himir Desai: And penn state wale earn more than 12vi pass
[02/06/23, 2:07:35 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see, lowest i can go is purdue, as my whole childhood i thought of purdue as a prestigious uni, and purdue is ranked 15 for mech
[02/06/23, 2:07:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: acceptance rate for purdue for mech is 30%
[02/06/23, 2:07:49 AM] Himir Desai: Tab to you will have to apply to india only kyuki after gap foriegn college mai chance even kam
[02/06/23, 2:08:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so even with shit 11th i’ll have a shot atleast
[02/06/23, 2:08:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no if i take gap
[02/06/23, 2:08:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be for jee
[02/06/23, 2:08:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i’ll do CS at an IIT
[02/06/23, 2:08:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i rlly don’t wanna take a gap
[02/06/23, 2:08:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my mom will make me want to kill myself
[02/06/23, 2:08:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yar worst case i’ll go to BITS cs
[02/06/23, 2:09:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if i am able to study atleast 6-7 hours a day
[02/06/23, 2:09:11 AM] Himir Desai: Those fucking friends of yours have totally changed your future
[02/06/23, 2:09:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: worst case i’ll go to an IIT
[02/06/23, 2:09:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i know bro it’s so
[02/06/23, 2:09:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: irritating
[02/06/23, 2:09:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it fucking bothers me daily
[02/06/23, 2:09:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: fucking irritating ass fuckinf
[02/06/23, 2:09:40 AM] Himir Desai: For me instead of a gap year i wiuld rather go to BITS CS
[02/06/23, 2:10:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see with a 1570 SAT
99% in 12th
research papers etc
i should have a shot at atleast a georgia tech type uni
[02/06/23, 2:10:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or atleast they’ll be willing to hear reason of 11th duck up
[02/06/23, 2:10:30 AM] Himir Desai: Georia tech is not super easy
[02/06/23, 2:10:39 AM] Himir Desai: Assuming you get all this
[02/06/23, 2:10:47 AM] Ritvick Pandey: research paper
[02/06/23, 2:10:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: is the only
[02/06/23, 2:10:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: thing
[02/06/23, 2:10:55 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i can’t confirm
[02/06/23, 2:11:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 12th won’t be hard ( i’m talking ab midterms not boards)
[02/06/23, 2:11:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and SAT bhi hojayega
[02/06/23, 2:11:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: USA won’t care about boards na and 99 in midterms won’t be that hard
[02/06/23, 2:11:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be half the syllabus
[02/06/23, 2:11:33 AM] Himir Desai: Just finish things na then why aait for the last moment SAT abhi de deni thi and should have closed that chapter
[02/06/23, 2:11:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t know i’ll speak to a college counselor
[02/06/23, 2:11:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and see

[02/06/23, 2:12:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i had completely
[02/06/23, 2:12:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: closed
[02/06/23, 2:12:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: USA ka chapter
[02/06/23, 2:12:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but it’s too depressing
[02/06/23, 2:12:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t wanna study like a rat for 6 months
[02/06/23, 2:12:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then go to iit
[02/06/23, 2:12:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and study like a rat
[02/06/23, 2:12:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for 4 more years
[02/06/23, 2:12:35 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and then do some job
[02/06/23, 2:12:42 AM] Himir Desai: For me midterms would be harder than boards kyuki our school gives very hard papers
[02/06/23, 2:12:48 AM] Himir Desai: And checking is even harder
[02/06/23, 2:13:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: not like that bro
[02/06/23, 2:13:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in midtemrs
[02/06/23, 2:13:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: limits continuity sifferentiability

[02/06/23, 2:13:56 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ll speak to a college
counselor
[02/06/23, 2:13:57 AM] Himir Desai: Hamare midterms mai most probably it would be Functions ITF Limit Conti. diff. MOD
[02/06/23, 2:14:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i rlly wanna go to us
[02/06/23, 2:14:05 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or atleast oxford/imperial
[02/06/23, 2:14:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i can’t apply
[02/06/23, 2:14:36 AM] Himir Desai: Where
[02/06/23, 2:14:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: to uni of edinburgh cs
[02/06/23, 2:14:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: either
[02/06/23, 2:14:51 AM] Ritvick Pandey: since my essay will be mechanical based
[02/06/23, 2:15:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and same essay goes to all 5 choices
[02/06/23, 2:15:57 AM] Himir Desai: My counsellor said that for top tier colleges i should apply for data science instead of CS cause its easier and then after a year change Major
[02/06/23, 2:16:07 AM] Himir Desai: UK mai not possible though
[02/06/23, 2:16:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: smart
[02/06/23, 2:16:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: can’t in UK tho
[02/06/23, 2:16:19 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan exactly
[02/06/23, 2:16:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and i don’t wanna
[02/06/23, 2:16:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: try and bring in both
[02/06/23, 2:16:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and mess up my chances
[02/06/23, 2:16:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in both the places
[02/06/23, 2:16:43 AM] Himir Desai: Mech ke liya itna pyar maine kisika nahi dekha
[02/06/23, 2:16:56 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 😭😭😭
[02/06/23, 2:17:13 AM] Himir Desai: Did you enjoy thats BITS ka mechanical workshop
[02/06/23, 2:17:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no that was so shit
[02/06/23, 2:17:22 AM] Himir Desai: That*
[02/06/23, 2:17:30 AM] Himir Desai: Nahi not what we sid
[02/06/23, 2:17:32 AM] Himir Desai: Did*
[02/06/23, 2:17:39 AM] Himir Desai: What those students were doing
[02/06/23, 2:17:53 AM] Ritvick Pandey: As a kid, I always had ideas for things I wanted to make or build, but I didn’t have the skills to do that. When selecting a major, I though ME would probably be the best choice to gain those skills.
[02/06/23, 2:18:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: this best describes my condition
[02/06/23, 2:18:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t have much interest in studies i just enjoy math and physics, i’m not going into those fields, as i don’t wanna be poor
[02/06/23, 2:18:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i enjoy building things ( which is why ME is good )
[02/06/23, 2:18:52 AM] Himir Desai: For example
[02/06/23, 2:18:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if i’m doing a job i want to be at a managerial position
[02/06/23, 2:19:03 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i won’t do
[02/06/23, 2:19:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: a core engineering job anyway
[02/06/23, 2:19:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: which is why ME is perfect
[02/06/23, 2:19:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if not anyways i’ve imagined me building my own company
[02/06/23, 2:19:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for that also, engineering shud give me a good base
[02/06/23, 2:19:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: to have enough knowledge
[02/06/23, 2:19:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: to start a company
[02/06/23, 2:19:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: hence, Mech
[02/06/23, 2:20:04 AM] Himir Desai: It is well known ki engineers dont know how to manage companies (in india)
[02/06/23, 2:20:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s well known
[02/06/23, 2:20:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ki engineers
[02/06/23, 2:20:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: do know
[02/06/23, 2:20:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: how to manage companies
[02/06/23, 2:20:25 AM] Ritvick Pandey: idk about info
[02/06/23, 2:20:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: india*
[02/06/23, 2:20:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the worlds richest people are engineers
[02/06/23, 2:20:57 AM] Ritvick Pandey: not doing what they majored in
[02/06/23, 2:21:08 AM] Himir Desai: Nahi hamare math sir allen Vadodara centre head he did his engineering then Management from IIM then he did lots of company mai kaam
[02/06/23, 2:21:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: most of the engineers are at a managerial position and not doing their core job such as my dad
[02/06/23, 2:21:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: same my dad did
[02/06/23, 2:21:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: engineering then IIM se management
[02/06/23, 2:21:42 AM] Himir Desai: And he always tells us ki you should do a management degree after engineering kyuki engineering will give you the knowledge of how to make things but not how to make profit
[02/06/23, 2:21:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bro but
[02/06/23, 2:21:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if i’m from a reputed college
[02/06/23, 2:22:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in india IIT
[02/06/23, 2:22:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: companies like mckinsey
[02/06/23, 2:22:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: directly pick up IITians
[02/06/23, 2:22:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and give managerial roles
[02/06/23, 2:22:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and abroad also, even in finance fields, they pick up engineers cause they’re smart, and just teach them the basics themselves
[02/06/23, 2:22:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: rather than getting a finance guy
[02/06/23, 2:23:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so my job dream isn’t mech related
[02/06/23, 2:23:18 AM] Ritvick Pandey: like how urs is CS related
[02/06/23, 2:23:42 AM] Himir Desai: But then my dad isnt from IIT and he makes crores per year my friends dad isnt from IIT and he makes crores every year
[02/06/23, 2:23:56 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ofcourse if i get an idea and build a cool enough product for a company then it’ll be mech related warna no
[02/06/23, 2:24:10 AM] Ritvick Pandey: both ppl
[02/06/23, 2:24:13 AM] Ritvick Pandey: are making crores
[02/06/23, 2:24:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t see the

[02/06/23, 2:24:35 AM] Himir Desai: both aren’t from IIT
[02/06/23, 2:24:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see same with my dad, he’s not from IIT but he’s making crores
[02/06/23, 2:24:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but
[02/06/23, 2:24:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the ratio
[02/06/23, 2:24:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: of non iitians making crores
[02/06/23, 2:24:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: is v less
[02/06/23, 2:24:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: with ratio of non iitians making fuckall
[02/06/23, 2:25:15 AM] Himir Desai: I mean IIT is not everything you cam still make crores but the mehnat will increase
[02/06/23, 2:25:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: like sir was teling me
[02/06/23, 2:25:22 AM] Ritvick Pandey: exactly
[02/06/23, 2:25:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: why increase
[02/06/23, 2:25:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the mehnat
[02/06/23, 2:25:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: one of his friends got picked up my this stock company in canada
[02/06/23, 2:26:03 AM] Himir Desai: Our sir has a law of conservation of mehnat if you dont want to do mehnat in future study 12 hours like a rat right now
[02/06/23, 2:26:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: alot got picked up by petroleum companies like schlumberger
[02/06/23, 2:26:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for a crore
[02/06/23, 2:26:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and in 2000s that was mad
[02/06/23, 2:26:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: LMAO no way
[02/06/23, 2:26:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: MY DIR SAID
[02/06/23, 2:26:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the same exact thing
[02/06/23, 2:26:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: he said there is a law of conservation of mehnat
[02/06/23, 2:26:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: u do now and then do in IIT
[02/06/23, 2:26:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and then relax
[02/06/23, 2:27:00 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or do now don’t do in iit do a little later on
[02/06/23, 2:27:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: etc etc
[02/06/23, 2:27:14 AM] Himir Desai: Then how can you not expect mehnat in future also not do mehnat right and and still earn crores
[02/06/23, 2:27:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: anwyays
[02/06/23, 2:27:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no i will do
[02/06/23, 2:27:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: mehnat

[02/06/23, 2:27:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t mind right now also
[02/06/23, 2:27:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i just don’t like
[02/06/23, 2:27:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the Jee way
[02/06/23, 2:27:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and would rather do mehnat for US colleges
[02/06/23, 2:28:23 AM] Himir Desai: IITs mai bhi its the same way only maintaining GPA and all
[02/06/23, 2:28:38 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ?
[02/06/23, 2:28:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no in college
[02/06/23, 2:28:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no matter what
[02/06/23, 2:28:46 AM] Ritvick Pandey: my life will be fucked
[02/06/23, 2:28:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and i’m fine with that
[02/06/23, 2:28:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i’m saying
[02/06/23, 2:28:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’d rather prep for US colleges then IITs
[02/06/23, 2:29:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: even tho my 11th is fucked
[02/06/23, 2:29:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: leave, it’s an endless topic of discussion with no solution
[02/06/23, 2:29:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: only option is to do IIT since US is gone
[02/06/23, 2:29:56 AM] Himir Desai: When I was in 7th 8th i though ki when i will get in 11th i will leave SS and Hindi and Sanskrit and only Maths and Science life would get so much easier and it didn’t. 
Abhi i think ki when i go to college i will do all the subjects i love it would be so much easier but will it be
[02/06/23, 2:30:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: wdym? only sci is so much more peaceful
[02/06/23, 2:30:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i fucking hated hindi
[02/06/23, 2:30:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: fucking chutiya subject
[02/06/23, 2:30:47 AM] Himir Desai: Ask yourself again are you at peace right now ki when you were in 7th
[02/06/23, 2:31:16 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in an ideal world, in college i’d take-
engineering physics  or
physics or
math or
statistics or
mechanical and cs
[02/06/23, 2:31:23 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and be happy studying
[02/06/23, 2:31:31 AM] Ritvick Pandey: that isn’t a fair comparison
[02/06/23, 2:31:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: imagine hindi right now, with the same increase in toughness PCM had
[02/06/23, 2:31:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: compare
[02/06/23, 2:32:02 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in 7th only
[02/06/23, 2:32:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: only PCM in 7th
[02/06/23, 2:32:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or PCM hindi in 7th
[02/06/23, 2:32:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: see if we were in US we’d be bless
[02/06/23, 2:32:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: we’re only struggling
[02/06/23, 2:32:27 AM] Ritvick Pandey: since we’re Indians
[02/06/23, 2:32:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: which is why we’re not at peace
[02/06/23, 2:32:57 AM] Himir Desai: My point is that its not that in future life would get easier or harder its just that the hardness will change its source so waiting ki future mai it will be easy tab i will do full mehnat is nit the way
[02/06/23, 2:33:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or else in an european country our life would be better off with just math n science in 12th
[02/06/23, 2:33:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: im not saying
[02/06/23, 2:33:15 AM] Himir Desai: We deal with what we have
[02/06/23, 2:33:17 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’ll be easy in future yaar
[02/06/23, 2:33:20 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ur not understanding
[02/06/23, 2:33:35 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no matter where i go, or what it is, 4 years of hardwork is there no matter what
[02/06/23, 2:33:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i will do it
[02/06/23, 2:33:39 AM] Ritvick Pandey: in college
[02/06/23, 2:33:41 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but right now
[02/06/23, 2:33:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: there is an option
[02/06/23, 2:33:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 6 month of fuckallness
[02/06/23, 2:33:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for 4 years of indian college
[02/06/23, 2:34:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: or 6 months of enjoyable abroad mehnat
[02/06/23, 2:34:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for 4 years of usa college
[02/06/23, 2:34:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’d choose this
[02/06/23, 2:34:15 AM] Ritvick Pandey: over this
[02/06/23, 2:34:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: solely because i like the outcome more
[02/06/23, 2:34:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and because i don’t like mugging like a rat 24-7
[02/06/23, 2:35:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: like doing ECs, writing Essays, acing school exams OR JEE
[02/06/23, 2:35:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i’d rather do the first option
[02/06/23, 2:35:09 AM] Ritvick Pandey: is what i’m saying
[02/06/23, 2:35:14 AM] Himir Desai: What about the chances of you getting that outcome if you do fuckallness/majedar mehnat
[02/06/23, 2:35:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: and now i don’t have enough time to do both
[02/06/23, 2:35:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for an IIT, i need to do ONLYjee now
[02/06/23, 2:35:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if i started in 11th i could do both, now it’s too late
[02/06/23, 2:35:43 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i have to choose one
[02/06/23, 2:35:58 AM] Ritvick Pandey: exactly that’s the issue
[02/06/23, 2:36:06 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i won’t get US college even if i do that
[02/06/23, 2:36:07 AM] Himir Desai: You have 1 year for IIT because JEE main mai to bas >90%ile lana hai
[02/06/23, 2:36:14 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so my only option is jee
[02/06/23, 2:36:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: no bro
[02/06/23, 2:36:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: jan mai mains
[02/06/23, 2:36:26 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then boards
[02/06/23, 2:36:29 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then mains again
[02/06/23, 2:36:32 AM] Ritvick Pandey: oreboards
[02/06/23, 2:36:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: etc etc
[02/06/23, 2:36:36 AM] Ritvick Pandey: too much
[02/06/23, 2:36:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: work
[02/06/23, 2:36:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for me to do iit prep
[02/06/23, 2:36:44 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so i’m only counting
[02/06/23, 2:36:49 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 6 serious months
[02/06/23, 2:36:59 AM] Ritvick Pandey: ofcourse
[02/06/23, 2:37:01 AM] Ritvick Pandey: if i leave
[02/06/23, 2:37:04 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the abroad dream
[02/06/23, 2:37:07 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then i have
[02/06/23, 2:37:11 AM] Ritvick Pandey: 1 full year
[02/06/23, 2:37:28 AM] Himir Desai: Advance ka padhega to mains ka to ho hi gaya boards ke liye exam ke 2-3 din pehle padh lena and agar tab tak college decisions aa gae to yato boards ka tension chala jaega ya JEE ka
[02/06/23, 2:37:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but i feel like i have atleast a shot
[02/06/23, 2:37:50 AM] Ritvick Pandey: at abroad still
[02/06/23, 2:38:08 AM] Ritvick Pandey: haan that’s what, if abroad dream is gone by jan then i’ll have 6 more months
[02/06/23, 2:38:12 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so 1 full year
[02/06/23, 2:38:21 AM] Ritvick Pandey: but
[02/06/23, 2:38:24 AM] Himir Desai: Yeah but the bars you have set are too high
[02/06/23, 2:38:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: for the 1 full year
[02/06/23, 2:38:28 AM] Ritvick Pandey: i have to make decision now
[02/06/23, 2:38:37 AM] Ritvick Pandey: either completely ditch abroad applications and do jee
[02/06/23, 2:38:48 AM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s too confusing man
[02/06/23, 2:38:52 AM] Ritvick Pandey: yaar
[02/06/23, 2:38:54 AM] Ritvick Pandey: you don’t understand
[02/06/23, 2:38:54 AM] Himir Desai: Ask your dad na

[02/06/23, 2:39:24 AM] Ritvick Pandey: bro my dad will say “hojayega bas hard work karo “ then my mom will come in and say” LEAVE US AND ALL DO IIT PREP”
[02/06/23, 2:39:42 AM] Ritvick Pandey: then my dad will be like yeah if that’s the only option do off

[02/06/23, 2:40:30 AM] Ritvick Pandey: obviously
[02/06/23, 2:40:33 AM] Ritvick Pandey: the logical answer is

[02/06/23, 2:40:40 AM] Ritvick Pandey: study for JEE
[02/06/23, 2:40:45 AM] Ritvick Pandey: so that is what dad will say

[03/06/23, 8:41:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: anything under 100k usd is unacceptable
[03/06/23, 8:42:01 PM] Himir Desai: Ha that is to also the case for me i just thought from your texts ki you want some 500K starting salary
[03/06/23, 8:42:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i mean yes

[03/06/23, 8:43:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but college with highest placements
[03/06/23, 8:43:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: was IIT Kanpur
[03/06/23, 8:43:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: u didn’t answer when i asked to guess
[03/06/23, 8:44:07 PM] Himir Desai: I thought you asked to guess where your friend wanted to go and paid 20Lacks

[03/06/23, 9:07:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 500k usd
[03/06/23, 9:07:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: sick as fuck
[03/06/23, 9:07:35 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but the highest EVER is probably from harvard or MIT only
[03/06/23, 9:07:38 PM] Himir Desai: what i always think of india vs us is that us is wait i will send you a graphic
[03/06/23, 9:07:53 PM] Ritvick Pandey: na but

‎[03/06/23, 9:09:27 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[03/06/23, 9:09:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: niche US
[03/06/23, 9:09:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: upar india
[03/06/23, 9:09:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s not a continuous rise
[03/06/23, 9:09:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s constant after some point
[03/06/23, 9:09:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: US ka starting is india ka ending constant value
[03/06/23, 9:10:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but that is because having 1cr salary in india is like having 300k usd salary in USA
[03/06/23, 9:10:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 200*
[03/06/23, 9:10:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: 200-300
[03/06/23, 9:10:54 PM] Himir Desai: Array nahi i didnt went into that much detail what i just wanted to show is india mai majority very less minority super high (average salary wale bhi hai but they just barely live) US mai its more even distribution

[03/06/23, 9:12:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: up*
[03/06/23, 9:13:04 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the lower y value of india will be a little longer
[03/06/23, 9:13:44 PM] Himir Desai: Isme which is better i cant figure out
[03/06/23, 9:14:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: india mai the gap is huge between rich and average ppl
[03/06/23, 9:14:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the average ppl are a lot more in number and are very poor
[03/06/23, 9:14:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in usa the poor and average have a small gap
[03/06/23, 9:14:23 PM] Ritvick Pandey: while there’s still plenty of rich

[03/06/23, 9:14:59 PM] Ritvick Pandey: more accurate
[03/06/23, 9:15:12 PM] Himir Desai: Mere jesa hi hai
[03/06/23, 9:15:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: no the thing is
[03/06/23, 9:15:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in india
[03/06/23, 9:15:21 PM] Ritvick Pandey: yes
[03/06/23, 9:15:31 PM] Himir Desai: Ye india nahi general hai
[03/06/23, 9:15:36 PM] Ritvick Pandey: this is mine
[03/06/23, 9:15:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if you’re from a normal college
[03/06/23, 9:15:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: your starting salary and your salary when you’re 40 are very different
[03/06/23, 9:16:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you might start off at 3-4 LPA
[03/06/23, 9:16:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but with time you could come to crores
[03/06/23, 9:16:16 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but then it becomes constant at 1/2cr
[03/06/23, 9:16:34 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if you’re from a college like IIT your starting and ending salary doesn’t have a huge difference
[03/06/23, 9:16:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: for the average people ofcourse
[03/06/23, 9:16:58 PM] Ritvick Pandey: for a hardworking person it’ll be a lot more
[03/06/23, 9:16:58 PM] Himir Desai: Nahi na the thing in india is if you are not from IIT then instead of increasing your salary they will kick you and hire someone at lowet salary (if your skills are replaceable)
[03/06/23, 9:17:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: no that’s what
[03/06/23, 9:17:08 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’m saying
[03/06/23, 9:17:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: let me finish
[03/06/23, 9:17:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: this is
[03/06/23, 9:17:20 PM] Ritvick Pandey: an exceptional non IITian
[03/06/23, 9:17:28 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and this is an average IITian
[03/06/23, 9:17:46 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the exceptional non IITian overtakes the average IITian
[03/06/23, 9:17:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: this happens to the average Non IITian
‎[03/06/23, 9:18:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[03/06/23, 9:19:01 PM] Ritvick Pandey: avg non iitian graph i’d say
[03/06/23, 9:19:34 PM] Himir Desai: Ha sahi
[03/06/23, 9:20:14 PM] Himir Desai: Par ye internet pe US college research is very difficult every website shows different dat
[03/06/23, 9:20:16 PM] Himir Desai: Data*
[03/06/23, 9:21:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ruk mai ghar pahuchke text karta hoon
[03/06/23, 9:21:16 PM] Himir Desai: Ha thik hai
[03/06/23, 9:37:12 PM] Ritvick Pandey: only check
[03/06/23, 9:37:15 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the colleges own website
[03/06/23, 9:37:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: for placement statistics
[03/06/23, 9:39:32 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in purdue
[03/06/23, 9:39:34 PM] Ritvick Pandey: for mech eng
[03/06/23, 9:39:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: avg is 80k
[03/06/23, 9:39:45 PM] Ritvick Pandey: higher side is 135k
[03/06/23, 9:39:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: means if i grind in college
[03/06/23, 9:39:54 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i can get 135k starting
[03/06/23, 9:40:05 PM] Ritvick Pandey: which is 1.1cr
[03/06/23, 9:40:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: that’s decent
[03/06/23, 9:43:59 PM] Himir Desai: Ha but finding that is also very difficult ekto colleges ki websites are a maze usme bhi there are hidden links
[03/06/23, 9:44:17 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan
[03/06/23, 9:44:41 PM] Himir Desai: Ha 135K would be a good starting salary 3 saal mai atleast 150-160K and isme bonus to alag se hoga
[03/06/23, 9:44:56 PM] Ritvick Pandey: haan that’s what
[03/06/23, 9:45:00 PM] Ritvick Pandey: in 3 saal
[03/06/23, 9:45:07 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i should be at minimum 200k if i’m still working
[03/06/23, 9:45:10 PM] Ritvick Pandey: which i won’t be
[03/06/23, 9:45:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and once i hit the 200-300k wala range
[03/06/23, 9:45:34 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and i can apply to a prestigious business school (harvard business) for mba
[03/06/23, 9:45:42 PM] Ritvick Pandey: this is all if i don’t have a startup
[03/06/23, 9:46:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: the starting avg salary of a harvard mba guy is 200k, if you go into a field you already have experience in ( which i will ) then your salary is a lot higher
[03/06/23, 9:46:30 PM] Ritvick Pandey: since my salary was alr 200k
[03/06/23, 9:46:33 PM] Ritvick Pandey: after harvard mba
[03/06/23, 9:46:38 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i’ll be straight into managerial positions
[03/06/23, 9:46:43 PM] Himir Desai: And i have seen ki while getting a job there is a negotiation round jisme you can negotiate to increase your salary. And usme everyone says itni badha do itni badhado and they get a rise but not what they expect instead what i will do and what other smart people do is they ask for more paid leave and other benefits like health and transport and vacation allowance and all
[03/06/23, 9:46:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: so 300 no 400 no 500kish
[03/06/23, 9:46:53 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it should be
[03/06/23, 9:46:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: and once you’re at such a level
[03/06/23, 9:47:02 PM] Ritvick Pandey: there’s so many chances of growth
[03/06/23, 9:47:18 PM] Himir Desai: Harvard MBA is stem?
[03/06/23, 9:47:32 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i meant
[03/06/23, 9:47:39 PM] Ritvick Pandey: if you go into a job field
[03/06/23, 9:47:44 PM] Ritvick Pandey: you already have experience in
[03/06/23, 9:47:50 PM] Ritvick Pandey: AFTER graduating
[03/06/23, 9:48:29 PM] Himir Desai: Nahi i asked because non stem ko they give only 1 H1B chance
[03/06/23, 9:48:36 PM] Himir Desai: Stanford MBA is stem that i know
[03/06/23, 9:48:49 PM] Ritvick Pandey: idk what all that is bro
‎[03/06/23, 9:48:55 PM] Ritvick Pandey: ‎image omitted
[03/06/23, 9:49:09 PM] Ritvick Pandey: stanford MBA was always the choice
[03/06/23, 9:49:11 PM] Ritvick Pandey: until recently
[03/06/23, 9:49:14 PM] Ritvick Pandey: when i got to know
[03/06/23, 9:49:19 PM] Ritvick Pandey: how much BANK these harvard boys make
[03/06/23, 9:49:28 PM] Himir Desai: If its stem MBA then you get 3 H1B chances
[03/06/23, 9:49:37 PM] Ritvick Pandey: still don’t know what that means
[03/06/23, 9:49:48 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i mean i can make out a rough idea
[03/06/23, 9:49:57 PM] Ritvick Pandey: but
[03/06/23, 9:50:00 PM] Ritvick Pandey: no clue what ur saying
[03/06/23, 9:50:03 PM] Ritvick Pandey: what the fuck is a
[03/06/23, 9:50:05 PM] Ritvick Pandey: h1b chance
[03/06/23, 9:50:35 PM] Himir Desai: You need to have a work visa to work in USA and uska naam hai H1B but to get it you have to go through a lottery jiske stem mai you get 3 chances and non stem mai 1
[03/06/23, 9:50:36 PM] Ritvick Pandey: why are you stressing over VISA rn
[03/06/23, 9:50:43 PM] Ritvick Pandey: it’s very easy to get
[03/06/23, 9:50:46 PM] Ritvick Pandey: i don’t think
